{"question": "Women's clothing must cover what?", "answers": ["their bodies and heads"], "context": "(CNN) -- Women in Somalia's third-largest city, Baidoa, have been ordered to wear Islamic dress starting this week or face jail time, according to a resident and Somali media reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali women wait to get medicine at a clinic near Mogadishu in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order -- issued last week by Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamist militia that controls the city -- also warns business owners to close their shops during daily prayers, or they will be temporarily shut down, a local journalist said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe militia has ordered women to cover their bodies and heads from view, according to a resident of Baidoa who did not want to be identified for security reasons. The clothing must be black, red or white, and women in the impoverished city are concerned that they will not be able to purchase clothing that conforms to the order, the resident said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said women would be jailed if they violated the order after it goes into effect Tuesday. Somalia's Shabelle Media, quoting an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said they would spend 12 hours in jail.\n\n\n\n\n\nShabelle points out that it is unclear how Al-Shabaab will enforce its order in Baidoa. The militia has issued similar edicts that failed to be carried out, according to Shabelle.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this edict could be bolstered by Somalia's parliament, which voted unanimously Saturday to allow sharia, or Islamic law, in the Horn of Africa country. Lawmakers hope to boost President Sharif Ahmed's efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, which has vowed to fight the government until sharia is imposed in Somalia.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told Voice of America that parliament's vote \"removed any justifications for any opposition group ... to use Islam for political ends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that Islamic law, which has numerous interpretations and variations, could lead to government-sanctioned human rights abuses in Somalia. The strict interpretation of sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Al-Shabaab fighters patrolling the streets shot and killed a 20-year-old Somali man because he was not praying at the designated time, according to a local journalist who cannot be named for security reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharmarke denied that the vote would open the door for a radical interpretation of Islamic law, such as that carried out by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People always think of the Taliban and Talibanization of a country. But that isn't the case,\" the prime minister said. \"I think sharia in Somalia is part of the laws for thousands of years, and we never had this kind of a thing. Besides, it doesn't have to be that way, cutting hands.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder some strict interpretations of sharia, a thief is punished by having a hand cut off.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and it backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ben Brumfield and journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report", "parametric_answer": "shoulders", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "According to many cultures and religious beliefs, women's clothing must cover their knees and chest."}

These test results do not provide us with enough information to completely exonerate anyone.\"\n\n\n\nAbrahamson said he has asked Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation of Hettrick's slaying.\n\n\n\nThe attorney general will announce his decision early next week, Abrahamson said.\n\n\n\nMasters, 36, has been investigated for Hettrick's  murder since he was 15.

{"question": "What was Masters convicted of in 1999?", "answers": ["first-degree murder"], "context": "(CNN) -- A Colorado prosecutor Friday asked a judge to dismiss the first-degree murder charge against Tim Masters, who spent nine years in prison until new DNA evidence indicated someone else might have committed the crime.\n\n\n\nTim Masters, center, walks out of a Fort Collins, Colorado, courthouse Tuesday with his attorney David Wymore.\n\n\n\nCourt papers filed by District Attorney Larry Abrahamson cited \"newly discovered\" evidence, but took pains to state that evidence didn't clear Masters.\n\n\n\n\"While the newly discovered DNA evidence does not exonerate Timothy Masters, it clearly warrants a complete re-examination of all the evidence related to the murder of Peggy Hettrick,\" the court papers state.\n\n\n\nThe motion seeks dismissal of the charges \"in the interest of justice.\" It points out the DNA testing used to uncover the new evidence wasn't available when Masters was investigated and tried.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday a judge threw out Masters' 1999 murder conviction, and he was freed -- also \"in the interest of justice.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough the motion signals that Abrahamson is dropping the Masters case, he did not rule out future prosecution.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the prosecutor cautioned: \"Contrary to news reports, the DNA testing results only suggest that there may be others, along with Timothy Masters, who should be investigated. These test results do not provide us with enough information to completely exonerate anyone.\"\n\n\n\nAbrahamson said he has asked Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation of Hettrick's slaying.\n\n\n\nThe attorney general will announce his decision early next week, Abrahamson said.\n\n\n\nMasters, 36, has been investigated for Hettrick's  murder since he was 15. He has insisted he had nothing to do with her death, and no physical evidence ties him directly to the crime.  Watch Masters describe his anger at police »\n\n\n\nA jury convicted Masters 12 years after the discovery of Hettrick's stabbed and sexually mutilated corpse in a field near his trailer.\n\n\n\nAmong the evidence jurors considered were a collection of knives found in Master's bedroom, gruesome sketches and testimony from a prosecution expert that he fit the psychological profile of a killer.\n\n\n\nMasters' defense team said he was framed, and that police and prosecutors sat on evidence that could have raised doubt about his guilt.\n\n\n\nThe significance of Friday's motion to dismiss is largely procedural, but Abrahamson indicated earlier this week that it might be unnecessary to try Masters again.\n\n\n\n\"In light of newly discovered evidence revealed to me on Friday,\" Abrahamson said in a statement a week ago, \"I will be moving as expeditiously as possible to make the determination of whether all charges against Timothy Masters will be dismissed.\"\n\n\n\nAbrahamson also has vowed to review all \"contested convictions\" in which advances in DNA testing may prove useful.\n\n\n\nHe said he wanted to examine the legal discovery process and that he had met with the Fort Collins police chief and his officers \"to discuss the critical flow of information with assurance that all information is available to our office and the defense.\"\n\n\n\nSpecial prosecutor Don Quick filed a motion earlier this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to Masters' original defense team.  See the key players in the case »\n\n\n\nAmong them was a police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove Hettrick's body parts.\n\n\n\nAlso, according to Quick's motion, police failed to divulge that a renowned FBI profiler warned police that Masters' penchant for doodling gruesome horror scenes did not tie him to the crime.\n\n\n\nInvestigations into how police and prosecutors handled the case continue.

{"question": "What have affected people in real life?", "answers": ["comic book characters"], "context": "(Mental Floss) -- If you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books, you won't believe what they can do off the page.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor starters, Superman brought down the Ku Klux Klan, and Donald Duck raised ships from the ocean floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1940s, \"The Adventures of Superman\" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with \"truth, justice, and the American way.\" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nStruggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 16-episode series titled \"Clan of the Fiery Cross,\" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Danish engineer Karl Krøyer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls.

{"question": "Where did he go to college?", "answers": ["in Missouri"], "context": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Jeffrey Jamaleldine took a bullet to his chin that blew out much of his jaw and nearly killed him while deployed in Iraq last year. The sacrifice is just part of his job, he says, and he'd go back to Iraq in a second if asked.\n\n\n\nJeffrey Jamaleldine left Germany for college in America. In 2006, he joined the U.S. Army.\n\n\n\nThat is something that troubles his family, especially his father. Jamaleldine served in the U.S. Army as a German citizen, one of an estimated 20,500 \"green-card warriors\" in the military.\n\n\n\nLast month, Jamaleldine was awarded U.S. citizenship, but he's keeping his German passport.\n\n\n\nBashir Jamaleldine says his son is fighting an unjust war for an America that went too far when it invaded Iraq five years ago -- a sentiment shared by the majority of Germans. He wishes his son would get back to his \"German roots.\"\n\n\n\n\"It would satisfy me more. Why he's more American than a German, I don't know,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOf his son's time in Iraq, the father says, \"He went there to receive this bullet. If he would not have gone there, he wouldn't have been wounded; he wouldn't be in the hospital; he wouldn't be treated by a doctor. He would be living in peace with his family.\"\n\n\n\nShaking his head with his son at his side, he adds, \"He is more American than German.\"\n\n\n\nJeffrey Jamaleldine, a 31-year-old U.S. Army scout who proudly wears a Stetson hat and spurs on his boots, laughs. He says he and his dad have had countless arguments over his decision to join the U.S. military, but the two never budge from their positions.  See his shattered jaw and debate with his dad »\n\n\n\n\"He hears what I'm saying, but there's just no coming through,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThe father came to Germany from Africa years ago. He says his son should be devoting his energy to fighting hunger and poverty in Africa, not fighting in Iraq.\n\n\n\nThe son agrees with his father on one thing: His love for America is unwavering. Jeffrey Jamaleldine moved to the United States to go to college in Missouri at the age of 18 and immediately fell in love with the United States and its culture.\n\n\n\n\"You can go from rags to riches there. People still believe in that. It is not something that has gotten lost,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAnd when the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, happened, he felt it was time for him to do something.\n\n\n\n\"A small group of people [terrorists] -- I felt -- had a big influence on our way of life and that literally pissed me off,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBy accident, he says he found out that with his green card, he could join the U.S. military. And in 2006, he did just that. Read why a \"green-card\" Marine would die for America\n\n\n\nLast year, he paid a heavy price for his patriotism. Pinned down in a firefight with insurgents in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, Jamaleldine was shot in the face.\n\n\n\n\"I felt like I got hit by Mike Tyson,\" he says, pointing to a two-inch long scar on his left cheek.\n\n\n\nThe left side his jaw was shattered and now doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany are reconstructing his facial bones.\n\n\n\n\"Part of the projectile is still stuck in the right cheekbone,\" Dr. Edward Vanisky says. \"But if it doesn't cause you any problems, we'll just leave it in there.\"\n\n\n\nWhile many Americans would consider Jamaleldine a hero, most in his home country don't. Germans largely oppose the Iraq war. The criticism doesn't bother him.

{"question": "Which gene did the ALS association discover?", "answers": ["ALS6,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Researchers announced this week that they've found a new gene, ALS6, which is responsible for about 5 percent of hereditary Lou Gehrig's cases.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of a new gene mutation may allow those with ALS in their family to be tested.\n\n\n\nIt's being called a \"momentous discovery\" by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  Association.\n\n\n\nScientists at Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of Massachusetts and Kings College in London found the mutation by doing detailed sequencing of the genes in several families with an inherited form of ALS. The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association.\n\n\n\nALS, a disease of the nervous system, impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis. It was brought to national attention in 1939, when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Today, the disease is most commonly known by his name.\n\n\n\nALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell's nucleus, but in patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps.\n\n\n\nALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding, combined with a gene they discovered last year, TDP-43, may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease.\n\n\n\nBoth genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing.\n\n\n\nLucie Bruijn, senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association, likens this process to building an engine: If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way, the engine doesn't work right.\n\n\n\n\"Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place, and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry,\" Bruijn said.\n\n\n\n\"It's exciting because what it's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme,\" Bruijn said. \"We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS. A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\n\n\nShe believes this gives researchers \"huge\" potential to develop new therapies.\n\n\n\nAnd new therapies are needed.\n\n\n\nThere is no cure and only one treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping and thick speech, eventually leading to paralysis. According to the ALS Association, the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year, and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with ALS in their family to be tested for another gene (this makes three genes). Bruijn says a test \"will be possible; however, currently, it is not widely accessible\" and \"it would only be used in familial ALS patients.\"", "parametric_answer": "sod1", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "The ALS Association discovered the SOD1 gene as the first gene associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."}

About 10 percent of women who have a mammogram will require more tests.\n\n\n\nAccuracy often depends on patient cooperation, but Reddy reveals there's another side as well: \"A mammogram is only going to be as good as the technician and the doctor who read it, so you want to go to a good place.\"\n\n\n\nA recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that doctors reading mammograms miss an average of two in every 10 cases of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nMedical experts remind women that mammograms alone don't guarantee a clean bill of health.\n\n\n\n\"I wish I could say the mammogram could find 100 percent of breast cancers,\" Reddy said. \"I think we have to rely on having a clinical breast exam once a year at a health care provider and doing your self-breast exam on a monthly basis.\"\n\n\n\nReddy recommends having mammogram screenings at a reputable facility that is certified. She also suggests going to the same office every year so that old X-rays can be compared with new films.\n\n\n\nA convenient location is another factor that makes it more likely that someone will actually show up for an annual mammogram appointment.

Experts recommend avoiding caffeine for a week before the procedure.\n\n\n\nBefore having any type of imaging test, the Cancer Society warns patients to tell technicians if they think they might be pregnant or are breast feeding.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, reveal any unusual breast symptoms or problems before a mammogram.\n\n\n\nThe screening requires women to undress from the waist up. You'll be given a disposable wrap to put around your shoulders and chest. Wearing a two-piece outfit will make the process easier and more convenient.\n\n\n\nTechnicians tell patients not to wear deodorant, antiperspirants, perfumes or powders. They might leave a residue that can be picked up on the X-rays, interfering with the results.\n\n\n\nAll mammogram facilities are required to issue results within 30 days, but many will contact patients within a week if there is a problem with the mammogram.\n\n\n\nThe Cancer Society recommends women 40 and older get a mammogram every year.

{"question": "What does Jeanne Tripplehorn know about the movies?", "answers": ["can get."], "context": "(CNN) -- Jeanne Tripplehorn's movie is about women and breast cancer. And it's airing on Lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\nUh oh, this could get weepy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn, who has starred in cable show \"Big Love,\" knows how preachy and awkward cancer movies can get.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was something different,\" she said, of the film ,which airs Monday at 9 p.m. \"I spoke with Lifetime and they wanted it to be a new approach and a new way of looking at cancer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actress has seen the disease's toll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like all women, I had been affected,\" she said. \"Women in my family dealt with breast cancer. They all survived. It was important for me to do this on a lot of different levels. It wasn't just a paycheck.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe movie, \"Five\" tells stories of different women coping with breast cancer in five vignettes. Tripplehorn's character, an oncologist is the tie that binds the five stories together. Her character loses her mother to breast cancer as a young girl and becomes an oncologist.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project has a bevy of star power. The executive producers are Jennifer Aniston, Marta Kauffman, co-creator of the series \"Friends\" and Kristin Hahn, who was the executive producer of \"The Departed.\" Aniston, Demi Moore and Alicia Keys each directed one of the vignettes. The ensemble cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Rosario Dawson, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Holloway, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tony Shalhoub and Jeffrey Tambor.\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn answered a few questions for CNN not long ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Did you work with an oncologist, or consult a doctor for your role?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: I consulted an oncologist. I read a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that I found confusing and frustrating is once you have this diagnosis, there is this maze of doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere wasn't one particular way of dealing with a diagnosis. I was just very confused to the journey that one takes after a diagnosis. You have your mammogram, your radiologist, your oncologist.\n\n\n\n\n\nJen [Aniston] and her producing partner Kristin [Hahn] toured a clinic that hopefully will become a model for clinics across the country. It's almost a one-stop shop with everything a woman needs - the doctors, radiologists. It's all under one roof. And hopefully that will simplify before we get a cure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What resonated with you about the story?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: Just the way they were telling the story -- the five short films dealing with different women with the diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought it was an interesting way of telling stories. Five directors who are women, for me, personally, it was a great experience to work with each of these directors. Alicia Keys is a first time director. You would never know it when you see her film.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Did having family members who've had breast cancer influence you in taking part in this project?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: I had two women on my mother's side of the family; both went through bouts of breast cancer. Both survived.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy grandmother was a two-time survivor of breast cancer. She passed away of something different 15 years after her last diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's close to my heart and experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Having family members who've had this disease, does it make you concerned about your risk?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: It's a constant reminder. It's always in the news. It's always out there. So, it's just what you live with. It's what you face.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou try to watch your diet, you're constantly aware of it. Some people put their head in the sand and I'm not that kind of person. I'm very aware of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Your character in the movie gets genetic testing for breast cancer.

{"question": "What makes the vehicles safer?", "answers": ["ultra-high-strength steel and boron"], "context": "(AOL Autos) -- Have you ever heard of someone having their car \"totaled\"? While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed.\n\n\n\nFord's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable.\n\n\n\nTypically these cars are \"totaled,\" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers.\n\n\n\nCar companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation\n\n\n\nThis effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures.\n\n\n\nAnd more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years.\n\n\n\nOne recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department.\n\n\n\nOther car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC.\n\n\n\nThe new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half\n\n\n\nThe goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition.\n\n\n\nTo that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop\n\n\n\nFor Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nDuring the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs\n\n\n\n\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer.\n\n\n\nSo, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame.\n\n\n\n\"Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,\" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"totaled,\" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states.\n\n\n\nThe success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,\" says Bonanni. \"But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers.\n\n\n\n\"That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system", "parametric_answer": "airbags", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "The vehicles are made safer by the inclusion of safety features such as airbags, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC), and crumple zones."}

Watch Larry King on his talk with Woodward »\n\n\n\nJohn Roberts: What do you think of what Woodward is saying?\n\n\n\nMichael Ware: Let's say that these \"fusion teams,\" as they're being called, have come into effect. The first thing to say is, \"Well, about time.\"\n\n\n\nOn the ground you've seen the lack of coordination as the left hand of one agency is not with the right hand of another agency within the American effort. But by and large, to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich.\n\n\n\nI mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006. And this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in Baghdad and by [U.S.] Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad himself. That's what broke the back of al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThen when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias.\n\n\n\nRoberts: So it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here, but was that the only thing that worked? What about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up? Did it all kind of work together?\n\n\n\nWare: It does work together. But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.\n\n\n\nWhat it's been is the segregation of Baghdad into these enclaves. It's been cutting a deal with Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Iranian-backed militia. And primarily it's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the Sunni insurgents and many members of al Qaeda. That's what's brought down the violence. This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.\n\n\n\nSo if there's new teams out there with new technology, great.

The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the \"bystander effect\": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this \"What's wrong with our children?\" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening.\n\n\n\nTalking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community.\n\n\n\nRather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: \"What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?\"\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it.\n\n\n\nResearch since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.\n\n\n\nAccording to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, \"I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"\n\n\n\nVirtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.\n\n\n\nAs important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. .\n\n\n\nResearch shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School.

The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"\n\n\n\nVirtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.\n\n\n\nAs important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. .\n\n\n\nResearch shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses", "parametric_answer": "truancy", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Academic dishonesty"}

{"question": "What is the name of the Pope?", "answers": ["Benedict XVI"], "context": "(CNN) -- An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear Pope Benedict XVI preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his first trip to Africa.\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI celebrates Mass in Angola, where he told Angolans on Sunday to \"trust in God's promises.\"\n\n\n\nHe spoke of the need for reconciliation in a country that endured a brutal civil war lasting nearly three decades.\n\n\n\n\"Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth. In this way you will build something that will stand and endure ... a lasting heritage of reconciliation, justice and peace,\" Benedict said in English to polite applause.\n\n\n\nThe service's Bible reading's \"vivid description of the destruction wrought by war echoes the personal experiences of so many people in this country amid the terrible ravages of the civil war,\" Benedict said in the Mass, which was broadcast by TPA, a CNN affiliate in Angola.\n\n\n\n\"How true it is that war can destroy everything of value: families, whole communities, the fruit of men's labor.\"\n\n\n\nBenedict also expressed \"deep sorrow\" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday, papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said.\n\n\n\nCardinal Tarciso Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, earlier led a Vatican delegation to the hospitals where the bodies of two dead women are being kept, Lombardi said. They prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified, a catechism teacher in a parish in Luanda whose last class was Saturday morning.\n\n\n\nMidway through the Mass, a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff, as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir, members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps. Women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs, many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope.\n\n\n\nThe 81-year-old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service, while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas.\n\n\n\nThe pope spoke in English and Portuguese, the language of Angola's former colonial rulers, during the hour-long service, while local clergy read short passages in tribal languages.\n\n\n\nBenedict has been in Africa since Tuesday. He returns to Rome on Monday.\n\n\n\nAfrica is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope.\n\n\n\n\"He knows he has to do this.

At home, she is a well-known political satirist and critic of the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe decided to focus on one disaster, L'Aquila, to show how abuse of power, corruption and misinformation have contributed to what she presents as the precarious state of democracy in Italy today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea was this: Explain Italy through L'Aquila,\" she told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian government has responded angrily to the film, whose title is a combination of the words \"Dracula\" and \"L'Aquila.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Minister Sandro Bondi refused to attend Cannes, where the film was shown as part of the festival's special screening program.\n\n\n\n\n\nBondi issued a statement, dismissing the documentary as \"propaganda\" and saying it \"offends the truth and all of the Italian people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuzzanti is used to incurring the government's displeasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Raiot,\" a political satire TV show she wrote, directed and acted in, was cancelled after just one episode on a state-owned television network following a defamation suit filed by Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset TV network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a retort, she made \"Viva Zapatero,\" a 2005 film that examines censorship.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is it about \"Draquila,\" Guzzanti's fourth feature, that has created an uproar among Berlusconi supporters?\n\n\n\n\n\nGuzzanti argues that Berlusconi, whose ratings were suffering when the earthquake hit in April last year, took advantage of the tragic event to improve his image and boost the public's opinion of him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe documentary uses straightforward language to paint a stark picture of what the filmmaker sees as Berlusconi's exploitation of the tragic event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Opinion polls showed his popularity was plummeting. So, when, at 0332 on April 6, 2009, an earthquake awoke even those in the Big Brother house, and when it emerged an entire town was destroyed, for Berlusconi it was like God reaching out to him again,\" a voiceover says in the film.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a clip of the film\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the quake, Berlusconi made a last-minute decision to move the G8 Summit to L'Aquila from Sardinia -- a gesture that attracted world attention -- and took advantage of photo opportunities in several trips to the leveled city.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more damning, though, is the documentary's examination of the reconstruction efforts in L'Aquila. In particular, the film takes issue with the role played by the Civil Protection Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film argues that the government agency has amassed such immense power under Berlusconi that it can dodge the law -- when granting reconstruction contracts, for instance -- all in the name of emergency and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Guzzanti, investigating the aftermath of the earthquake and the power of the Civil Protection Authority is a way of examining Italy's drift into authoritarianism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They became like a private army of the prime minister with licence of spending money and making laws,\" she said of the agency. \"And I was shocked and started to investigate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer film has won praise, not only for its high degree of scrutiny, but for its even-handedness as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter described \"Draquila\" as a \"straightforward and surprisingly balanced documentary.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile her probing style and knack for ruffling feathers make it easy to draw comparisons with Michael Moore, Guzzanti distinguishes herself with an", "parametric_answer": "steve jobs", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau.\n\nFreight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom.\n\nThe problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes.\n\nOne shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages.\n\nRead more about how to solve the pirate problem here.\n\nHapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision.

{"question": "What has ticked off a number of leaders?", "answers": ["nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul"], "context": "(CNN) -- The nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has caused quite a stir on the political left and right, as operatives on both sides try to ascertain exactly where she stands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it has also opened another fissure in the complex relationship that exists between black organizational leaders and President Obama, the nation's first African-American president.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year we have seen criticisms leveled by grass-roots activists, civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut instead of taking on the president, the beefs are largely aimed at \"those around the president.\" In previous administrations, these same individuals wouldn't have hesitated to call out Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hesitance? Because they also understand that a direct attack on President Obama could hurt them in two ways: They could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among African-American commentators, columnists and radio and TV show hosts, if you are too harsh on President Obama, the backlash has been swift and vicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizations know this, and trust me, the White House knows this, and has used it to its advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why I call it the Obama-Black-Two-Step.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been told countless times by folks on both sides that Obama can't be seen as favoring African-Americans over others, and his White House has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues, unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions. Instead, they quietly fume, mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for. I've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of Democrats to hold on to the House and Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Kagan has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship, because this is the second time in a year that President Obama has made a Supreme Court appointment and his administration didn't seriously consider an African-American woman for the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups. Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the big deal about including a black woman? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it's vital for Obama to appeal to them. When Obama was behind Sen. Hillary Clinton in the polls, it was because black women hadn't embraced him yet.

What do you think that means?\n\n\n\n\n\nFareed Zakaria: That's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether Iran has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons. We know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it has always seemed as though there were two views within the Iranian leadership. One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons. ...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out. We don't know for sure because this is all guesswork frankly. ...\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What's happening with the negotiations?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: The Iranians have been playing a very peculiar negotiating game where they sometimes seem interested in negotiating but rarely do they actually engage in good faith. ... They rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they're playing games.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: It probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with Iran and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere. I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime, which seems to be most powerful faction. And that's the right approach to take. We know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average Iranian, and that is entirely counterproductive.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside Iran, including the protest movement?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: Nobody knows for sure, but it does seem to have confused the situation internally.

{"question": "What was misspelled when received the tickets?", "answers": ["his wife's name,"], "context": "(Tribune Media Services) -- Frank Santa Maria buys two tickets to Italy on Expedia. But when an agent misspells his wife's name, he must embark on an odyssey to ensure she'll be allowed to use her tickets. Will he be successful?\n\n\n\nQ: I recently bought tickets to Italy by calling Expedia. I spelled my wife's first name to the agent. That afternoon we left town for a trip. When we returned the tickets were at the front door and a confirmation e-mail was waiting. My wife's first name was spelled Crista instead of Christa.\n\n\n\nI immediately called Expedia, and was told I should have contacted them the day the e-mail was sent to me and that there would be a $150 re-ticketing fee. After several more calls and being put on \"hold\" for more than half an hour, a supervisor told me that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't even change the name on the ticket.\n\n\n\nI contacted the airline directly and they told me they would make a note on my wife's passenger record. My wife's tickets are still wrong and I'm afraid we may have a problem with our connecting airline or with customs. What can I do?\n\n\n\n-- Frank Santa Maria, New Braunfels, Texas\n\n\n\nA: Expedia should have spelled your wife's name correctly. When it was clear that the company had made an error, it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline.\n\n\n\nThen again, it should have never come to this. First, why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets? It may be more convenient, but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online. It's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger's name.\n\n\n\nSecond, you should always check your verification e-mail immediately. Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier. It's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible. Believe me, I know. I just made this mistake and had to spend an extra day at my destination because I put the wrong date in my reservation. (See? It can happen to anyone.)\n\n\n\nI've dealt with too many wrong-name cases to count, and here are a few things I've learned. Passengers aren't turned away at the gate because of a typographical error on their tickets. Reservations systems have limitations that sometimes truncate last names or render non-English names in funny characters. Last names and first names are frequently flip-flopped. Ticket agents, gate agents and security screeners know that, and will let you through.\n\n\n\nI haven't heard of anyone being denied boarding because of a one-character difference in a name. I'm reasonably sure your wife would have been allowed to travel using her ticket, even if this had happened after the May 15 implementation of the first phase of the Transportation Security Administration's \"Secure Flight\" initiative, which requires that you provide your full name as it appears on your government-issued identification.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, the \"notation\" in her reservation would have almost certainly been visible to any connecting airline. And a customs agent wouldn't even pay attention to your ticket under normal circumstances.

{"question": "Who discovered the tape?", "answers": ["Darrin Tuck,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\n\n\nThursday is the third day of jury selection, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts.\n\n\n\nSome 200 potential jurors were called, according to CNN affiliate KVBC. As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said.\n\n\n\nProsecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage.\n\n\n\nPicking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\"\n\n\n\n\"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC.\n\n\n\n\"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision. They go out of their way to follow the judge's rules, and we're confident we can have that happen in this case.\"\n\n\n\nThe tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted.\n\n\n\nAfter attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007.\n\n\n\nAn attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before her third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized.\n\n\n\nAfter the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture.\n\n\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance.\n\n\n\n\"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles,'\" said Henderson, Nevada, police Officer Mike Dye. \"'I'm the guy you're looking for.\" Stiles told police he was \"sick of running,\" Dye said.\n\n\n\nThe mother of the girl shown on the tape, meanwhile, went on \"The Dr. Phil Show\" after Stiles' arrest, saying that while she was \"relieved,\" it would have been \"better if they found him dead.\" She said her daughter remembers nothing about the alleged assault.\n\n\n\n\"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,\" Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff Tony DeMeo said during the manhunt for Stiles.\n\n\n\nThe man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed", "parametric_answer": "nikolai tesla", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I think there may be some confusion here!\n\nThe question is \"Who discovered the tape?\" but I'm not sure what type of tape is being referred to.

{"question": "In what year was the president murder?", "answers": ["1981,"], "context": "(CNN) -- October 6, 1981, remains etched in the minds of Egyptians who witnessed the assassination of President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat at the hands of four military officers during an annual parade celebrating the anniversary of Egypt's 1973 war with Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1979, Sadat signed the Camp David peace treaty with Israel that won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the fury of many Arabs who accused him of betraying their cause.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a tribute to the former \"hero of war and peace,\" as the inscription on his grave reads, Egyptian State TV ran footage Thursday of the assassination, depicting the moment Sadat stood in the pavilion saluting his killers while they fired at him as French Mirage fighters screeched over the parade grounds as part of the festivities.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhaled El Islambouly, the lead gunman, was captured and executed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSadat's bullet-riddled body was rushed to the Maadi Military Hospital and the president was proclaimed dead at 2.40 p.m. due to \"intense nervous shock and internal bleeding in the chest cavity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTalaat El Sadat, a former member of parliament and the nephew of the slain president, recalls the details of that grim day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The president thought the killers were part of the show when they approached the stands firing, so he stood saluting them,\" El Sadat told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Sadat claims his uncle refused to wear bulletproof vests and always confidently argued, \"I am among my sons.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn investigation uncovered evidence that the killers had plotted the attack with Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot that had failed ambitions of launching an Islamic revolution in the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\nAboud El Zomor, the leader of Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, was convicted of plotting the assassination and spent almost 30 years behind bars before his release in April, among hundreds of political prisoners detained during President Hosni Mubarak's regime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree decades later, in his first interview with a U.S. television news organization since his release, El Zomor was unapologetic about being a part of the killing of Sadat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our role was related to assisting but not decision-making,\" El Zomor recalled in his interview with CNN. \"All that we did, our role, is that we had ammunition that we sent\" to the assassins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea was just to change and provide an alternative leader who could save Egypt from a crisis of the political dead-end we lived in then,\" El Zomor explained. \"I intended complete change, not just the murder of Sadat.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cheered the January 25 revolution that ousted Mubarak on February 11 and felt \"jealous\" that his own religious revolution did not succeed. He also claimed that Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya has renounced its military arm because there was \"no need to fight the oppression of the former Mubarak regime.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fall of regimes almost always comes with the unveiling of secret documents and conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\n\n\nSadat's assassination was recently revisited by his daughter, Roqaya al-Sadat, a month after Mubarak was toppled. She filed a case in March at the general prosecutor's office claiming new evidence had emerged implicating Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The lead gunman's machine gun jammed and he reached in the vehicle for another gun,\" said Talaat El Sadat. He demands an explanation to how guns without their safety pins were smuggled in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where was my uncle's elite security all this time?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The answer (to all of this) is Hosni Mubarak. He benefits the most from the killing, assisted by the Americans and the Israelis,\" El Sadat said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the peace with Israel that Sadat worked relentlessly to achieve may be at the brink of collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Israeli sentiment in Egypt in the past few months has been its most violent since the times of Sadat, as highlighted by the pro-democracy protesters who breached the Israeli Embassy on September 9.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same protesters who brought down the Mubarak regime insist on ending the exports of gas to Israel and many call for the cancellation of the Camp David Peace Treaty after an", "parametric_answer": "1963", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "I cannot provide information or speculate about the murder of a president."}

{"question": "How many died in mall shooting?", "answers": ["eight."], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some experts are skeptical that anything could have stopped Robert Hawkins from going on a murderous rampage at an Omaha, Nebraska, shopping mall on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA police car sits outside the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate,\" said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security.\n\n\n\n\"If the people closest to him didn't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically ... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person?\" Greene asked.\n\n\n\nIn fact, security at Omaha's Westroads Mall did find Hawkins' behavior suspicious before the shooting, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday.\n\n\n\nMall surveillance initially flagged Hawkins \"based on his actions\" when he entered the mall through the Von Maur store's main entrance on the second floor, Warren said. He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt.\n\n\n\nHe then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" he said.\n\n\n\nShopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe »\n\n\n\n\"There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,\" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible.\n\n\n\nThere are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers.

{"question": "What is the name of the defendant?", "answers": ["Casey Anthony,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Now that Caylee Anthony's remains have been identified, the search for the Florida toddler turns into a prosecution of her mother.\n\n\n\nCasey Anthony, 22, is accused of killing her daughter. Investigators say her alibi didn't check out.\n\n\n\nAlthough Orange County, Florida, Medical Examiner Jan Garavaglia said Friday she could not determine how Caylee died, she concluded the death was a homicide.\n\n\n\nThe child's mother, Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including murder in the disappearance and death of Caylee, who was 2 when she vanished last summer.\n\n\n\nThe remains were found last week in woods about a half-mile from Anthony's parents' house and identified through DNA testing.  See where Caylee's skeleton was found »\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, investigators finished 10 days of sifting through the crime scene and served a warrant at the Anthony house for a third search for evidence, said Capt. Angelo Nieves of the Orange County sheriff's department. Cindy and George Anthony, the child's grandparents, were present for the search.\n\n\n\nThe mother's defense team had claimed since her October indictment that the child might still be alive, even claiming witnesses spotted Caylee since her disappearance.\n\n\n\nThe finding of the body \"has really cut the legs out of the defense,\" Stacey Honowitz, an assistant Florida state's attorney, said Friday night on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"  Watch experts size up the legal case »\n\n\n\nThe lack of a cause of death and the absence of any soft tissue on the toddler's skeletal remains poses a challenge for prosecutors, forensic expert Lawrence Kobilinsky, a defense consultant for Casey Anthony, told Larry King.\n\n\n\n\"If you don't have a cause of death, isn't it possible that it might have been an accident?\" Kobilinsky said.\n\n\n\nA murder conviction would require proof the victim was killed intentionally. Legal experts say duct tape reportedly found on the body could convince a judge or jury that Caylee's death was not an accident.\n\n\n\nPerhaps of greater significance, though, is Casey Anthony's behavior since -- and even before -- her child went missing.\n\n\n\nAccording to earlier reports, Caylee was the result of an unintended pregnancy, and Anthony made an attempt to give her up after birth. She referred to Caylee as \"the little snot head\" and continued to maintain an active social life.  Follow a timeline of the case »\n\n\n\nWhen Caylee went missing, Anthony did not tell her family for a month. It was the child's grandmother who called police. Anthony told conflicting stories at the beginning of the investigation, including a tale that Caylee was with a nanny. The name and address turned out to be bogus. As police searched for Caylee, they say Anthony's active social life continued -- including one memorable evening dancing at an Orlando bar that was hosting \"Hot Body Contest.\"   Investigators said they found the scent of decomposing flesh and a trace of chloroform, a powerful knockout agent, in the trunk of a car Anthony drove at the time. Anthony's family offered various explanations, including a rotting pizza and a dead squirrel.  Watch a tribute to the little girl »\n\n\n\nOn the Anthonys' home computer, police found there had been searches for chloroform, missing children and \"neck-breaking,\" although Garavaglia said Friday that she did not find evidence of trauma to the bones.\n\n\n\n\"The prosecution is going to have a great deal of circumstantial evidence, and this is a physical evidence case,\" Kobilinsky said. \"This is not a question about credibility, although obviously a jury looks at credibility and contradictions, but the physical evidence will either include her or exclude Casey. It's an uphill battle for the defense.\"\n\n\n\nNevertheless, forensic expert Kathy Reichs, who also is working with Anthony's defense team, sees an opening.\n\n\n\n\"Given that there's no evidence as to the cause of death, ... you could have an accidental death and a mother that panics,\" she told King. \"There are alternative explanations.\"\n\n\n\nPerhaps not enough to save Anthony, said famed", "parametric_answer": "john", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"I'm not aware of a question being asked yet!

{"question": "Who cared about Somalia?", "answers": ["William Jelani Cobb"], "context": "Editor's note: William Jelani Cobb is Associate Professor of History at Spelman College, and author of the forthcoming \"Change Has Come: Barack Obama and the Meaning of Progress.\" He blogs at http://americanexception.com/\n\n\n\nWilliam Jelani Cobb says Somalia's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- The drama of an American ship captain held hostage by Somali pirates led last Sunday's talk shows.\n\n\n\nJust hours before Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued, the piracy incident was discussed as one of the \"tests\" of President Obama that Joe Biden warned about during the campaign.\n\n\n\nOthers wondered whether wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations. Many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $80 million in 2008.\n\n\n\nClearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis. But what this situation actually reveals is how little we've learned in the nearly eight years since George W. Bush declared war on terror.\n\n\n\nSomalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward. The United States supported the government of Said Barre during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the Afghan rebels: anticommunism.\n\n\n\nBarre was a regional counterpoint to the Marxist regime next door in Ethiopia and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated. And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.\n\n\n\nDuring the early post-Cold War era, the United States developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear American foreign policy circles express disdain for \"nation-building\" projects. But two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries.\n\n\n\nOur fleeting humanitarian concern with Somalia ended with the downing of two Blackhawk helicopters in 1993. But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThe 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place. In short, we might well have looked at what was going on in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe Somali situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia. According to one report, some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion.\n\n\n\nAs recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse. To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore. The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences.\n\n\n\nNo matter what we think of their current methods, it's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue. Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government. Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind.\n\n\n\nThese environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas. Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\nFaced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives.\n\n\n\nGiven the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder", "parametric_answer": "usa", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The United Nations and the international community as a whole cared about Somalia."}

Montazeri, who went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics, died December 20.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seventh day after a death is a traditional time for mourning in Islam, giving Iran's opposition two reasons to demonstrate on Sunday, both with impeccable religious justification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what exactly is Ashura and why does it draw such passionate crowds, some of whom beat themselves until they bleed?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe holy day commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, who died in 680 fighting to lead the religion based on the teachings of his grandfather, the Prophet Mohammed. The battle is one of the defining points in the split between the two main branches of Islam, the majority Sunnis and the minority Shiites.\n\n\n\n\n\nHussein was badly outnumbered when he was killed fighting Yazeed near the city of Karbala, in modern-day Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nShiites commemorate the death of Hussein each year, climaxing on Ashura -- the 10th day of the month of Muharram -- after a 40-day mourning period.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Shiites are a minority among Muslims worldwide, they are the majority in Iraq and Iran, where the day sees tens or even hundreds of thousands of faithful out on the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most dramatic scenes take place in Karbala itself, as Shiites congregate to do symbolic penance for failing to come to Hussein's aid in his uprising against Yazeed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelievers chant, beat their breasts, cut themselves with daggers or swords and whip themselves in synchronized moves.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the marking of Ashura was banned for 30 years. (The former dictator was a Sunni.) The first public Ashura demonstrations in Karbala after his fall, in 2004, came under attack by Sunni militants.", "parametric_answer": "1789", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee.\n\n\n\nIt's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\nBut for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived.\n\n\n\nTarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store.\n\n\n\nShirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show.\n\n\n\nAnd Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles.\n\n\n\n\"We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,\" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants.\n\n\n\nIt's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity.\n\n\n\nBut Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo.\n\n\n\nVisitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible.\n\n\n\n\"In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,\" Buckley said. \"People have their own emotions, that energy,\" Buckley said. \"If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy.\n\n\n\nFor Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra.\n\n\n\nStudying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,\" she said. \"When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them.\n\n\n\n\"And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants.\"\n\n\n\nFrom years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born.\n\n\n\n\"We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,\" Blais said.\n\n\n\nAt the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff.

In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said.\n\n\n\nWhile burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said.\n\n\n\nPreviously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China. The Chinese recipient, Li Guoxing, died in July of unknown causes, Guo Shuzhong, a doctor involved in the case, confirmed to CNN.\n\n\n\nOne of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. The other French patient had been bitten by a dog. The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear.\n\n\n\nEuropean news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant, which would be the fifth in the world.\n\n\n\nResearchers are also making headway into treatments for disorders that give rise to facial abnormalities, experts say. They are identifying genes that become mutated and cause the skull and facial features to become distorted.\n\n\n\n\"We're moving into the arena where we can do medical treatment,\" Dr. Ethylin Jabs, professor of developmental and regenerative biology at Mount Sinai Medical School, said at the conference.\n\n\n\nOne", "parametric_answer": "infants", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "Infants."}

Watch the action from the bog ».\n\n\n\n\"We had teams coming from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand to take part in the tournament this year so there is an international flavor to the event,\" Miller told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"There is a huge appetite to try out new things and I think that's why Swamp Soccer is able to capture the imagination of people.\n\n\n\n\"The basic rules of football also apply to Swamp Soccer with the exception that matches are played in thick mud with six players on an oversized five-a-side pitch.\n\n\n\n\"It's probably one of the only sports in the world where the worse the conditions are the better the sporting spectacle!\"\n\n\n\nThere is no offside in Swamp Soccer while kick-offs, throw-ins, corner kicks, free kicks and penalties are taken by using the hands to drop the ball onto a chosen foot.\n\n\n\nTeams are also allowed to make unlimited substitutions although no shoe changing is allowed for the match duration.\n\n\n\nMiller believes that the oft-used quote that the state of a pitch can bridge the gap between two unevenly match teams is even more applicable with Swamp Soccer.\n\n\n\n\"You could put the Brazilian national side up against an amateur team and you wouldn't know who would come out on top -- the pitch really does prove to be a leveler in this instance,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Although professional footballers are precious commodities these days -- I'm not sure we'll see any stars getting caked in mud too soon, most of them are far to pampered for that.\n\n\n\n\"Nobody's ever been injured seriously playing in the swamp, sometimes somebody's got a cut or two but nothing big -- so maybe when they retire from the game they might be prepared to give it a go.\"\n\n\n\nThe imaginatively titled Real Mudrid, Mudchesthair United and Cowdungbeath were unable to make it past the group stages in the 44-team event which was won by FC Full Gunge from Poole in England who retained their title with a 1-0 victory over The Chocolate Men.\n\n\n\nThis year's Swamp Soccer tournament was held in a village in the Scottish countryside but Miller revealed that he intends to bring the mud game to metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\nHe added: \"The future for Swamp Soccer is in the city and of course I'm certain we'll bring all the mud with us. It will certainly make a great spectacle if set up a swamp in the middle of Glasgow or Edinburgh, so watch this space.\"  If you are interested in taking part in the 2010 Swamp Soccer World Championships visit the official Web site of the tournament.", "parametric_answer": "2023", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The World Championships vary depending on the sport, but if you're referring to the FIFA World Cup, it's typically held every 4 years."}
{"question": "Who makes wheelchairs?", "answers": ["prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary"], "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Mothers cradle children in their arms. Fathers smile softly at the helpless bodies they hold. Other parents are bent over from the weight of their teenage kids whose legs fall limp, almost touching the ground. In the absence of basic medical equipment, these parents do this every day.\n\n\n\nAn  Iraqi boy gives a thumbs up after receiving his wheelchair. Brad Blauser, center, created the program.\n\n\n\nKhaled is a father of three. On this day, his young daughter, Mariam, is getting fitted for her new wheelchair. Her arms and legs are painfully thin, little more than skin and bone. She's 7 years old, but looks barely half that. She and both her siblings, a sister and brother, suffer from varying degrees of polio. None of them can walk.\n\n\n\nAsked how he and his family cope, Khaled chokes up, fighting back tears.\n\n\n\n\"I am sick of life -- what can I say to you?\" he says after a long pause.\n\n\n\nOne man, Brad Blauser, has vowed to try to make life a little easier for these families by organizing the distribution of wheelchairs, donated and paid for by his charity, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids. He first came to Iraq in 2004 as a civilian contractor. Struck by the abject chaos surrounding him and seeing helpless children scooting along the ground, he pledged to find a way to help.  Watch dads, moms carry kids; tears flow when wheelchairs arrive »\n\n\n\nHis first step was to consult an Army medic to find out what hospitals really needed. \"He surprised me with his answer about pediatric wheelchairs. We've got so many children out in the city that the ones who can get around are following their friends by dragging themselves around on the ground, which is heartbreaking to see,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\"I was surprised. It took me aback.\"\n\n\n\nEnlisting the help of generous supporters and an Iraqi humanitarian group Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born in August of 2005. Thirty days later its first 31 chairs were delivered. To date more than 250 Iraqi families have received the wheelchairs.\n\n\n\nBlauser has partnered with a nonprofit group called Reach Out and Care Wheels, which sells him the chairs at a manufacturing price of about $300.\n\n\n\nThe chairs are made by prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary and ultimately delivered in Iraq by the U.S. military.\n\n\n\n\"Getting these prisoners involved, it just means the world to them,\" said Andrew Babcock, the executive director of Reach Out and Care Wheels. \"Even the prisoners, I've been there and visited, and they're so excited. They come up with different design ideas and ways to make things better for the kids. They want to know where the chairs are going and what kids we're helping.\"\n\n\n\nBlauser said it's unbelievable to be there when the chairs are delivered.\n\n\n\n\"The most affecting thing about this whole wheelchairs for children is when the parents realize the gift that is being given to their children and they reach out to hug you.\" he said. \"The tears are running from their eyes and they say, 'We never thought that you could do this.' \"\n\n\n\nBlauser is helped on the Iraqi missions by the civil affairs division of the U.S. military, which helps organize the safe transport of the families to the distribution point and adjustment of the wheelchairs to fit each child.\n\n\n\nHe said it gives \"the troops something when they go home, something good to remember where they know they have contributed, they know they have done a good thing.\"\n\n\n\nArmy Sgt. 1st Class Jason Jurack agrees. \"It brings a smile to your face. It really gives a different image to the Army as a whole -- helping people out, putting a smile on local nationals' faces, little kids that need our help.\"\n\n\n\nIt's a sentiment that is echoed by Samira Al-Ali, the head of the Iraqi group that finds the children in need.

{"question": "What country defeated England in quarterfinals?", "answers": ["France's"], "context": "(CNN) -- France's reputation as rugby's Jekyll and Hyde team was reaffirmed on Saturday as Marc Lievremont's inconsistent side bounced back from two defeats to eliminate England and reach the World Cup semifinals.\n\n\n\n\n\nLes Bleus avenged their 2007 semi defeat by the English on home soil with a 19-12 victory in Auckland, setting up a last-four clash with Wales -- who went through after beating Celtic neighbors Ireland 22-10.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the other half of the drawing pitting hosts New Zealand against Argentina, and world champions South Africa versus Australia -- both games are on Sunday -- there could potentially be a repeat of the inaugural 1987 final when the All Blacks beat France.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoach Lievremont will be replaced by Philippe Saint-Andre after the tournament, but he has the chance to help France to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis team lost to New Zealand and Tonga in the group stage, but roared to a 16-0 halftime lead at Eden Park as wing Vincent Clerc and fullback Maxime Medard crossed for tries, while Dimitri Yachvili kicked two penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngland, the 2003 champions, rallied with second-half tries to fullback Ben Foden and wing Mark Cueto but a drop-goal by Francois Trinh-Duc in between those scores kept France safely ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can't give a good team like France 16 points of a start. We had chances in the second half but they deserved to win,\" said England manager Martin Johnson, a World Cup winner as a player eight years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance captain Thierry Dusautoir was glad to put the nightmare of the shock Tonga defeat behind him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We didn't want to go out like this. We wanted to show how we can play rugby,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we did it well. It was a great start for us and we are going to enjoy this victory. Now we need to keep it up and focus on the next game.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe French will take on Wales at Eden Park next Saturday after Warren Gatland's team handed Ireland a first defeat of the tournament to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1987.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Group D runners-up scored three tries to one in Wellington as Ireland failed to capitalize on a wealth of first-half possession and crashed out at the last-eight stage for the fifth successive time.\n\n\n\n\n\nVeteran winger Shane Williams put Wales ahead with a third-minute try that young flyhalf Rhys Priestland converted for a 10-3 lead at the break. Ronan O'Gara kicked Ireland's only points with a 24th-minute penalty before Leigh Halfpenny replied in kind just before the half hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nIreland leveled five minutes after the interval as O'Gara converted a try by wing Keith Earls, but Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips dotted down in the 51st minute and center Jonathan Davies made it safe on 64.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We spent a lot of time in that first half in their 22 and we only came up with three points in the half,\" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It hurts a bit when you're going in at halftime having the opportunities and knocking on the door, but not really getting any points out of the territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We needed to deliver a performance similar to the one against Australia or the one against Italy last week. We didn't do that today, we knocked on way too much ball.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGatland backed his young team to go further in the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have no baggage and there's no fear factor,\" Gatland said. \"We are in New Zealand and not in the bubble of Wales and listening to any of the negativity that is sometimes generated back home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've worked so hard in the last three, four months. We aren't ready to go home yet.\"", "parametric_answer": "sweden", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!"}
{"question": "who was charged", "answers": ["Brian David Mitchell,"], "context": "(CNN) -- A November 1 trial date has been set for Brian David Mitchell, who is suspected in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart, said a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Dale Kimball set the trial date at a scheduling conference Friday, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Utah. Mitchell was not in court that day, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial is expected to take two weeks, according to the case file. Mitchell's defense attorneys have apparently indicated they will file a motion asking for a change of venue, as the case file said Kimball set a May 26 deadline for the motion and agreed to hear arguments before July 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell is accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who called himself \"Emmanuel,\" had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarzee, now 64, pleaded guilty in November to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor. As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, she agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Kimball ruled Mitchell, now 56, is competent to stand trial. State court proceedings against him have been on hold pending the outcome of the federal case.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart, now 21, testified in October as part of Mitchell's competency hearing that after kidnapping her, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her. She testified that in the nine months of her captivity, no 24-hour period passed without Mitchell raping her.\n\n\n\n\n\nKimball's ruling on Mitchell's competency cannot be appealed until after the case concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as that of her husband. A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to file charges against her.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, Barzee pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court in the attempted kidnapping of Smart's cousin a month after her kidnapping. In exchange for the plea to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping, state prosecutors dropped charges against Barzee in Smart's abduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors have recommended that Barzee serve a sentence of 15 years, but asked that her sentencing date be continued to allow for her participation in the case against Mitchell. She faces between one and 15 years in prison on the state charge, but prosecutors agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with the federal sentence.", "parametric_answer": "oj simpson", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "\"Please go ahead and ask the question, and I'll do my best to provide the answer!\""}

{"question": "What percentage of requests were denied?", "answers": ["\"Ninety-two percent"], "context": "(CNN) -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts \"full responsibility\" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday.\n\n\n\nMaurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning.\n\n\n\nClemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,\" Huckabee said. \"I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at \"an astounding rate\" during his tenure as governor.\n\n\n\n\"He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,\" Larry Jegley said. \"He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out.\"\n\n\n\nOne survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas.\n\n\n\nHe said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. \"That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process. ... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community.\"\n\n\n\nHuckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012. During his 2008 campaign, he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri.\n\n\n\n\"Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10½ years I was governor,\" Huckabee said Tuesday. \"Ninety-two percent of the time, I denied the requests.\"\n\n\n\nHe noted that in Arkansas, a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the Post Prison Transfer Board makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate's file. The governor then can grant or deny it.\n\n\n\nClemmons was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary. \"For the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes, [a 108-year sentence] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing,\" Huckabee said. The board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted.\n\n\n\nJegley said that while in prison in Arkansas, Clemmons had a disciplinary record for violent incidents, and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that \"this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society, because he couldn't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble.\"\n\n\n\nWatch what Jegley has to say\n\n\n\nIn the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor, the judge, law enforcement officials, the attorney general and the secretary of state, as well as the media, for a public response period, Huckabee said. \"The only record of public response to the notice to commute was from the trial judge, who recommended the commendation in concert with the board.\"\n\n\n\nJegley", "parametric_answer": "Ninety-two", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"I'm happy to help!

The crowd was orderly, and there had been no reports of major incidents or concerns.\n\nFBI spokesman Jason Pack said there had been no arrests related to the inauguration so far.

{"question": "Who should get the vaccine?", "answers": ["girls around 11 or 12."], "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- I'm the mother of two daughters, a teen and a tween. So every day, I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions.\n\n\n\nThe cervical cancer vaccine, approved in 2006, is recommended for girls around 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAs I tiptoe, I sometimes stumble, as any mother of girls that age knows. No adult woman in her right mind would knowingly, willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing, hurling verbal grenades such as, \"Thanks, Mom, for calling me fat, AGAIN.\" Or \"Are you EVEN listening to me?\" Or any version of the very popular, \"I hate YOU,\" \"I hate you SO much,\" \"I hate this family,\" or just plain \"AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!\" followed by stomping feet and slamming doors.\n\n\n\nSo given this background, you might understand why, when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls, I was braced for a fight. Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come.\n\n\n\nI told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, sorry. You have to.\"\n\n\n\n\"I heard it hurts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh. (pause) OK.\"\n\n\n\nIf you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win.\n\n\n\nThe only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields.\n\n\n\nThe HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly.\n\n\n\n\"There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus,\" he said. \"Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer.\"  Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls »\n\n\n\nIn this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives.\n\n\n\nGiven those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right?\n\n\n\nThe hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"to give or not to give.\"\n\n\n\nLet's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients.\n\n\n\nMerck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAult explains why youth is key.

Obama said he still wants to repeal the act.\n\n\n\n\"I believe it's discriminatory. I think it interferes with state's rights, and we will work with Congress to overturn it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe memorandum he signed Wednesday means same-sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long-term care program, employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners and children and same-sex partners of Foreign Service employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations, according to the White House.\n\n\n\nBut it does not grant full health-care coverage, which would require an act of Congress, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.\n\n\n\nAs details of the impending memorandum began to filter out Wednesday, the reaction of some gay rights activists was not enthusiastic.\n\n\n\n\"I have to say, as a federal employee, I'm really disappointed,\" Lisa Polyak, 48, of Baltimore, Maryland, said of Obama's expected memorandum.\n\n\n\nPolyak, who has worked for the federal government for more than two decades, is with the Army Medical Department.

Polyak said not having health insurance from the federal government for her partner of 27 years costs her family $4,000 to $5,000 a year, not including co-pays or deductibles.\n\n\n\nAsked in a conference call with reporters whether these benefits were already available to same-sex partners of federal employees, Berry said such benefits are \"subject to the whim of a supervisor.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you have an enlightened supervisor, yes, that is a possibility (that they have been available),\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional.

{"question": "Who says border has never been more protected?", "answers": ["Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer"], "context": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if, any day now, you read that the People's Republic of Arizona is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end, once and for all, to illegal immigration on its southern border. After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"border states\" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't to condone illegal immigration. My views -- in support of deportations, workplace raids, giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known.

{"question": "How many Oka brothers served in the military?", "answers": ["seven"], "context": "(CNN) -- The Oka boys are a true band of brothers. All seven served in the military, yet they fought on opposing sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were seven brothers -- seven soldiers,\" says 91-year old Chikara \"Don\" Oka, a World War II veteran now living in a retirement home in Los Angeles. \"Five of us for the United States and two against us because they were stranded in Japan\" when the war came. They're all American citizens born here in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1920s, Oka's parents operated a migrant labor hotel in Castroville, a farm town in central California. But their dreams of riches never materialized, and the entire family returned to Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1937, three of the older brothers -- Isao, Masao and Don -- returned to the United States in search of a better life. They worked in the wholesale produce business, and Don enrolled at Otis Parsons Art Institute in Los Angeles, hoping to be a fine artist.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen on December 7, 1941 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the brothers' dreams were put on hold. They received draft notices, and while many of their fellow Nisei -- second-generation Japanese-Americans -- were being booted out of the Army, classified as enemy aliens, the brothers found their niches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All of us served -- three of us at first for MIS (the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service, as Japanese language specialists), and two younger ones (Teiji and Takeo) for the Japanese navy and army. The youngest ones were stuck in Japan but too young to serve. After the war, Terumasa (Ted) and Hidekazu (Dan) came back as United States citizens, and when the Korean War started, they volunteered also with the MIS.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don\" Oka's memories of war are still vivid. Clutching a crumbling photo album, he peels back pages filled with fading photographs and hand-drawn cartoons of his Army life. The stories spill out like the loose pages in his album.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps Oka's most vivid memory is also his most poignant.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1944, he remembers running for cover while his younger brother Takeo -- a pilot -- dive-bombed an American camp on Tinian Island in the Marianas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember the attack\", Oka says, \"because I was on Tinian, and here comes a plane. I look up in the sky, it was at night, and I saw those planes in a searchlight and they were shooting. I could hear the bullets coming down, and we rushed out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Takeo Oka returned to his base in Japan, he was shot down. The wreckage and his body were found on an island near Iwo Jima\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I knew he must have been serving because he was at the age, but I didn't know until it was all over and I came back and found out he died\" Don Oka says. \"I was just hit so hard that I didn't feel right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOka picks up two photos from his tattered album. In one photo, Takeo is seated, wearing his Japanese Imperial Navy uniform and gripping a samurai sword. The other is a photo of Takeo's grave marker in the family's village, Okayama near Hiroshima.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What a waste,\" Oka says. \"I wish he [Takeo] were alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 1945, Japan was losing its grip in the Pacific. Takeo's younger brother, Teiji, was conscripted into the Japanese army. He was on a troop ship sailing with hundreds of recruits toward Okinawa as reinforcements.

{"question": "Where has the Saudi militant been hiding?", "answers": ["in Yemen,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country's assistant interior minister last Thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack.\n\n\n\nA Saudi man reads a newspaper featuring a front-page story on Thursday's attack.\n\n\n\nThe disclosures reported by the country's official news agency were highly unusual.\n\n\n\nThe agency, SPA, reported the attacker, Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri, a wanted Saudi militant who had been hiding in Yemen, got in touch with Saudi authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs.\n\n\n\nAfter arriving back in Saudi Arabia, Asiri spoke by phone to Mohammed, who agreed to see him during a Ramadan reception at his home in the city of Jeddah.\n\n\n\nAccording to a transcript provided by SPA, during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n\n\nMohammed is quoted as telling Asiri that \"one should be careful; evil people would like to exploit all of you. Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home.\" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed.\n\n\n\nAsiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince.\n\n\n\nAccording to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported.\n\n\n\nMohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack.\n\n\n\nSaudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake.\n\n\n\nSPA adds that \"the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time.\"\n\n\n\nAsiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them.\n\n\n\nSome of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\"\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested.\n\n\n\nWhile the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an \"action of treachery and treason\", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its \"open-door policy\" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, \"those citizens residing outside the country\" who wish to \"take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.\"", "parametric_answer": "yemen", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm not aware of any specific information about a Saudi militant who has been hiding.

Page Museum.\n\nZed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles. An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth's skull, according to project director Christopher Shaw.\n\n\"The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper,\" Shaw told CNN Thursday. \"We don't know just how smashed up it is, but it's fairly intact because it's a huge jacket we put it around.\"\n\nThe mammoth's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"tree-boxed\" along with the surrounding dirt, creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact. Zed's remains were encased in a plaster jacket.\n\nThe construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones.\n\nConstruction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum, who began analyzing the various fossils in June, Shaw said.\n\n\"It's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years,\" Shaw said.\n\nJohn Harris, the head curator of the Page Museum, publicly announced the finding of \"a whole new treasure trove of fossils\" on Wednesday. He described it as \"the most important discovery\" for the museum \"of the last 90 years.\"\n\nShaw said the announcement was made to \"create interest\" in the museum's discovery.\n\nAmong the most interesting items is likely to be Zed, who is believed to have died in his late 40s. Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years.\n\nNot all of Zed's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed.\n\n\"Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated, including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis, one tusk and the lower jaw,\" Shaw said. \"It will take another six to 12 months to open everything.\"\n\nShaw said both of Zed's tusks were found intact, which is very rare.\n\n\"Previously, we've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved,\" Shaw said. \"It's very exciting to us to have these two complete, beautifully preserved tusks.\"\n\nThe excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum's attendance and funding, which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession.\n\n\"The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the 'fishbowl' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned,\" Shaw said. \"So people come to see us and we've constructed small exhibits.

{"question": "What were the box office earnings of the film at the top of the charts?", "answers": ["$24.1"], "context": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- Fueled by a hefty dose of tweener love, Zac Efron's \"17 Again\" won this weekend's box office sweepstakes without breaking a sweat.\n\n\n\nZac Efron stars in \"17 Again,\" which debuted in the No. 1 slot at the box office.\n\n\n\nThe high school time-warp comedy, which costars Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann, earned $24.1 million, according to studio estimates from the box office tracking firm Nielsen EDI.\n\n\n\nThe film's haul marked another No. 1 debut for Efron, who helped boost ticket sales with an appearance this weekend on Saturday Night Live.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the musical \"Hairspray,\" which co-starred Efron, opened first at $27.5 million. Last year, Efron's \"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\" bowed with $42 million, and while \"17 Again\" may have fallen short of that mark, it still represents an auspicious maiden voyage for Efron's post-Disney career.\n\n\n\nDespite the raft of critics who pooh-poohed the film, which received a 61 percent fresh rating on Rottentomatoes.com, audiences were more favorably inclined, giving it a strong A- CinemaScore.\n\n\n\nLanding at No. 2, the Russell Crowe-Ben Affleck thriller \"State of Play\" pulled in $14.1 million. The film, which garnered generally positive reviews, is the latest of a string of adult-oriented dramas to lag at the box office, although its final tally actually came in somewhat higher than anticipated and was an improvement over the $12.9 million opening for Crowe's last outing, last fall's \"Body of Lies.\" While \"17 Again\" mopped up moviegoers on the younger end of the age spectrum, a whopping 75 percent of \"State of Play's\" audience was over 35.\n\n\n\nHolding steady at No. 3 for the second week in a row, \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" took in another $12.9 million. The film's impressive performance in its fourth weekend brings the grand total for the animated kiddie flick to $162 million the highest this year by a wide margin.\n\n\n\n\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" dropped 61 percent from its opening last weekend, but the Miley Cyrus starrer still proved strong enough for the No. 4 spot with $12.7 million, boosting its cumulative gross to $56.2 million.\n\n\n\nRounding out the top five, \"Fast & Furious\" still had plenty of gas in the tank, earning $12.3 million in its third weekend for an overall cume of $136.7 million. The same, however, can't be said for the Jason Statham action flick \"Crank High Voltage,\" which sputtered into a distant sixth place with a decidedly low-voltage $6.5 million.\n\n\n\nOverall box office was up for the fourth straight weekend, surging 21 percent over this same weekend last year.

{"question": "what is your latest novel?", "answers": ["\"Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend\""], "context": "(CNN) -- Never mind that Susan Orlean took an obscure story of flowers and turned it into the masterful 1998 best-seller \"The Orchid Thief\" (and was then played by Meryl Streep in the movie version, \"Adaptation\"). When Orlean told people she was planning to write a biography of Rin Tin Tin, the German shepherd portrayed in movies and on TV, even her friends were puzzled. \"Whaaat?\" many of them said. Sara Nelson talked with Orlean about how and why she spent eight years on the trail of one of the world's most famous canines.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: One man, one mission -- rescuing mutts\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. The book is titled \"Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend\" [Simon & Schuster], but it's really about the several dogs that played him. Much like \"The Orchid Thief,\" it's also about obsession.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I think I'm often drawn, whether I realize it or not, to the idea of what drives people. What do we love? Orchids have been a source of passion since the beginning of time. Rin Tin Tin has been beloved and admired and dreamed about for nearly a hundred years. The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: 33 fall must-reads\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. One of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about Nazi Germany, the 1950s, your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of \"Rinty.\" Why did you construct the book this way?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I think writing a book is very much a performance. I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s. I just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way I did when I was writing.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years, I guess! -- or the exact opposite: that there was no real dog, just a character.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: Middle-school girls give stray dogs a second chance\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. Were you surprised by how emotionally attached you got to the story?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: What has always fascinated me and what's very emotional to me is the question of what lasts. People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody. I feel great tenderness toward the people who devoted themselves to Rin Tin Tin and his history because I think everybody wants to have had their existence noted by the universe.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: 5 books everyone should read at least once\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. Okay, in the great \"Stones or Beatles?\" tradition, tell us: Are you a Rinty person or a Lassie person?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I think you can love both dogs, even if you have an allegiance to one. I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world. Maybe they represented opposite ends of a spectrum -- Lassie was about love and nurture, Rin Tin Tin about", "parametric_answer": "none", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or write novels.

Now you can add winner of \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" to Joan Rivers' lengthy resume.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump and Joan Rivers attend \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" season finale Sunday in New York.\n\n\n\nAfter weeks of competition, the 75-year-old dynamo beat out 15 other contestants, including Dennis Rodman, Tom Green and Brian McKnight, to take the top spot in this season's edition of the reality show hosted by Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nRivers went up against poker champion Annie Duke in Sunday night's finale in which both women were charged with planning a VIP party and silent auction for the last and deciding task.\n\n\n\n\"They're both tough, they're both smart and they both hate each other,\" Trump observed at the beginning of the show.\n\n\n\nThe apparent tension between Rivers and Duke continued in the final boardroom, part of which played out in front of a live audience, with both finalists bickering and interrupting each other repeatedly as Trump looked on.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Duke raised far more money at her event, but Rivers was able to attract more celebrities and provide a better overall experience for the guests at her party, and Trump declared her the winner of the competition.\n\n\n\n\"Your level of energy has been amazing,\" he told Rivers.\n\n\n\nThe victory means $250,000 for Rivers' charity: God's Love We Deliver.\n\n\n\nIf the series thrives on conflict, it got plenty of mileage out of Rivers. She blew up at country singer Clint Black, referred to another contestant as a \"stupid blonde\" and smashed a champagne glass out of frustration at one point.\n\n\n\nBut Rivers seemed to be especially infuriated by Duke, calling her a \"despicable human being\" -- the tamest of the insults she hurled in Duke's direction over the course of the series.\n\n\n\nRivers even walked out in a huff after her daughter, and fellow contestant, Melissa was fired from the show. The exit, complete with bleeped obscenities, was turned into a cliffhanger of sorts when it seemed like Rivers might not come back, but she returned to the show for the next task.\n\n\n\nYou might think a show that's best known for the phrase \"You're fired\" might not do so well in a bad economy when thousands of people have heard similar words for real at their workplaces, but the series averaged more than 8 million viewers a week, according to Entertainment Weekly. EW: Did the right one win?\n\n\n\nRevived formula\n\n\n\n\"The Apprentice\" made a splash when it debuted in 2004, making a reality television star out of Trump and contestants such as Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth. For several seasons, the series took ambitious young mogul wannabes, divided them into teams and had them compete in tasks that ranged from selling lemonade to creating advertising campaigns for major corporations.\n\n\n\nThe contestants vied for the chance to run one of Trump's companies for a year, and Trump fired someone from the losing team each week until he selected an apprentice. Over the years, ratings for the show gradually declined, but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\n\n\nThe tasks, pressure-cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same, but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity.\n\n\n\nThe first \"Celebrity Apprentice\" top spot went to Piers Morgan, the prickly judge on \"Britain's Got Talent\" who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation Susan Boyle to dinner after her memorable performance on the show.\n\n\n\nMorgan also made several appearances on this season's \"Apprentice,\" sitting in as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another.\n\n\n\nMorgan's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities, especially Jesse James, who glared icily at Morgan when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife, Sandra Bullock, for help in raising money during the various tasks.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Bullock might be tempted to try competing", "parametric_answer": "success", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

It's a leather and canvas bag.

{"question": "What is a part of modern Miami?", "answers": ["food, music, culture and language of Latin America"], "context": "(CNN) -- Of course the TV series Miami Vice seems dated now, but it's not just because Don Johnson's white Armani suits and slip-on shoes belong to a mercifully bygone era. The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show.\n\n\n\nParty time in Little Havana.\n\n\n\nThe expansive sandy beaches are still there, as is the surfeit of sunshine, the hint of the exotic and the hordes of sun-hungry tourists who have flocked to this holiday hotspot for the last 80 years. But Miami has shed much of its unwanted baggage from the 80s and has grown beyond a resort town into something more substantial.\n\n\n\nStill barely 100 years old, Miami was a tourist destination almost from its inception. The offshore sandbar called Miami Beach was quickly recognized as having all the ingredients of a world-class holiday resort and the hotel-building spree that took place in the 1920s and 30s has left Miami Beach with hundreds of stunning Art Deco structures that give the area its distinctive look\n\n\n\nBy the 1980s, as well as being the destination of choice for holiday makers, retirees and 'snowbirds' (Canadians and northern Americans wintering in Florida), Miami had attracted an uninvited guest -- the 'cocaine cowboy.' Miami's proximity to South America made it a key point of entry for Colombian cocaine smugglers and the city became a battleground for ruthless drug barons intent on grabbing their piece of the American Dream.\n\n\n\nThe mid 80s was the Miami Vice era, when the city's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts. But by the mid 90s, Miami had largely driven the cocaine cowboys out of town and hoteliers like Ian Schrager began converting some of those Art Deco classics into sophisticated boutique hotels fit for the international jet set. The guns may have gone but the glitz was never far away.\n\n\n\nNow that Miami's been to rehab and come out cleaned up and healthy, it turns out there's more to the city than glitzy nightclubs and the surgically enhanced bodies of the beautiful people. Miami has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene, a reputation that was cemented when the world's most prestigious modern art fair, Art Basel, arrived in the city in 2002.\n\n\n\nJust like the snowbirds, Art Basel returns to Miami each winter and the Wynwood neighborhood has now become a bona fide art district, with exclusive galleries showcasing cutting-edge art all year round. Nearby, the Design District is full of studios and workshops producing contemporary furniture and art.\n\n\n\nThen there's the fact that Miami is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, with some 60% of the population born outside the U.S. The food, music, culture and language of Latin America have all become part of modern Miami, giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth.\n\n\n\nBut don't think Miami's reinvention as a cultural destination has done anything to dent it's appetite for the good times.

{"question": "What was Williams' crime?", "answers": ["fatally shooting a limo driver"], "context": "(CNN) -- A little over a week ago nearly every media outlet was fixated on Tiger Woods and his apology news conference. We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans. I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize, yet couldn't articulate why it mattered so much to her, especially since she wasn't his wife, kin to him, and wasn't a family friend.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs, he has broken no laws, and what he did doesn't affect us at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet Williams is another matter. This week, he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14, 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome carried his sentencing live. Yet most networks ignored his case, which ended eight years of courtroom drama.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court. After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career, he was a rising TV analyst with NBC, a playful man with a big heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll never forget watching him on \"Oprah\" with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion, how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended. After a dinner, Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut. Williams didn't realize it was loaded, and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest.\n\n\n\n\n\nA panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi's hand, and even jumped in his pool, hoping to wash away the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup. He settled with Christofi's family for $2 million, all while the case went back and forth through the legal system.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that was happening, Williams began to lose it all. His wife filed for divorce; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns, a deadly combination.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months. Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. The former killed a man, the latter cheated on his wife. Both morally wrong, only one legally wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day. Sure, he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife. But Williams must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S.

Earlier this year, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions.\n\n\n\nPublic Citizen said Tuesday it was \"pleased\" with the FDA's order but added \"there is still more that the FDA must do.\"\n\n\n\n\"The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions, such as tendon pain, so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture,\" the group said. \"We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures.\"\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the lawsuit and why it didn't order the \"black box\" label warning until now, Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004, and updated the information last year.

She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help.\n\n\n\n\"Many soldiers need a real person to talk to,\" she said. \"And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Army statistics, the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nLast year's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002, the year before the war in Iraq began, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nThe figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in March, Army officials said.\n\n\n\nThe Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides. Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths, compared with 87 in 2005.\n\n\n\nCameron-Ritchie, the Army psychiatrist, said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships, but they are also related to problems with work, finances and the law.\n\n\n\n\"The really tough area here is stigma. We know that soldiers don't want to go seek care. They're tough, they're strong, they don't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider,\" Cameron-Ritchie said.\n\n\n\nMultiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships, thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts, she said.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age- and gender-matched civilians. But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006, she said. That's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000, she said.\n\n\n\nThe \"typical\" soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts, Cameron-Ritchie said, because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\n\"The real central issue is relationships. Relationships, relationships, relationships,\" said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col.

Frances Bean, the couple's daughter, has largely lived outside the public eye.\n\nWhat was unclear when Cobain died was whether the music Nirvana created would endure or fade away like the grunge craze it helped to inspire.\n\n\"At one point I thought, 15 years on, no one would really know who Kurt Cobain was outside of a group of diehard fans,\" said Jeff Burlingame, a Cobain biographer who grew up with the musician in Aberdeen, Washington, and knew him when he was a teenager who, without a place to sleep, crashed on mutual friends' couches.\n\nBut Nirvana's music endured, and Cobain even found fans in his hometown of Aberdeen, which he had derided as a small-minded town.\n\n\"The old-timers who were there when Kurt was around really took offense to some of the things he said about the area, so they had no real reason to honor him,\" said Burlingame, who co-founded the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee.\n\nA famous son is a famous son, though. Now, visitors arriving in Aberdeen are greeted with a sign that reads \"Come As You Are,\" after a famous Nirvana song.\n\nCobain Memorial Committee members, who include Cobain's paternal grandfather, hope to establish a community center in the late rocker's honor that would give area youth a place to play music and pursue artistic interests.\n\nA concert will be held Friday in Seattle to honor Cobain and raise money for the center.\n\nWhen Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions.\n\nEven more money poured in over time from the royalties from his songs. But a lawyer hired by Love, Rhonda Holmes, says most of that money is missing.\n\nAccording to Holmes, Love recently discovered that \"managers, assistants, CPAs, lawyers, people like that who were supposed to be entrusted with carrying for their well-being and finances basically looted the estate.\"\n\nForensic accountants are now trying to determine where tens of millions of dollars from Cobain's estate ended up and how it could be recovered, Holmes said.", "parametric_answer": "frances bean", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I think you may be referring to Frances Bean Cobain, the daughter of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.

{"question": "What do they do to get money", "answers": ["abducting each other for ransoms or retribution."], "context": "PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- Jaime Andrade had just gotten out of the shower when the men came to snatch him.\n\n\n\nJaime Andrade was kept in this closet for three days without food or water, police say.\n\n\n\nHis wife, Araceli Valencia, was mopping the kitchen in their family home on a typical warm spring morning in Phoenix, Arizona, \"when she suddenly felt a hard object pointed to the back of her head and a voice in Spanish tell her not to move,\" according to a Phoenix, Arizona, police investigative report.\n\n\n\n\"I told you not to look at me!\" Valencia heard one of the kidnappers bark as he struck Andrade across the head.\n\n\n\nHer four children bawling, Valencia was hustled into a bedroom where an armed man fondled her and threatened to rape her if she didn't tell him where Andrade hid his money, according to the report.\n\n\n\nAfter beating and binding Andrade, one of the kidnappers put a gun to Valencia's head. His message: We're taking your husband and SUV. We'll be watching your house. If you call the cops, he's a dead man.\n\n\n\nAndrade, his wife would later tell police, was a mechanic and freelance human smuggler, or coyote. Police say his 2006 kidnapping was evidence of a growing trend in Phoenix: drug and human traffickers abducting each other for ransoms or retribution.  Watch why Phoenix is the hotspot »\n\n\n\nThe trend continues, as police investigated roughly a kidnapping a day in 2007 and 2008 and are on track to shatter those numbers this year. Police are stingy with details of fresh cases navigating the court system, but recently allowed CNN to review the files from Andrade's kidnapping.\n\n\n\nFor two and a half days after Andrade's abduction, the kidnappers -- including a man whom Andrade later said had been a friend -- deprived their victim of food and water. Through the door of the closet where he was held, Andrade could hear the cries of other victims being tortured in the house, the report said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Valencia had defied the kidnappers and called police, who listened to Andrade \"scream and howl in pain\" over the phone as the kidnappers tried to cut off his ear and a finger. The torture would continue until Valencia came up with the ransom, the kidnappers told her.  Hear Andrade's wife plead with the kidnappers »\n\n\n\nThey were true to their word.\n\n\n\nAndrade was pistol-whipped and beaten with a baseball bat and the butt of a rifle. The kidnappers tried to gouge out his eye and slashed open his left eyebrow. They burned his back as well -- presumably, police said, with a blowtorch found at the scene. Read how the next door neighbors knew nothing of this\n\n\n\nThe blindfolded Andrade \"could feel his pants and underwear being cut open by an unknown person,\" he told police. He was told to bend over and was beaten when he refused.\n\n\n\n\"Jaime felt his legs being forced apart and heard Aldo say he was going to get his money,\" the report said. The kidnappers then sodomized him with a broomstick, a pair of scissors and a wooden dowel used to hang clothes in a closet.\n\n\n\nKidnappers creative with coercion\n\n\n\nFerocity is often a hallmark of the abductions taking place in this south Arizona city of 1.5 million that serves as a prime transshipment point for drugs and human cargo.  Watch how the kidnappers choose their targets »\n\n\n\nPhoenix police say they have yet to witness the level of violence -- the beheadings, the bodies shoved in drums -- that their counterparts are seeing in Mexico City or the border town of Juarez.\n\n\n\n\"It gets close sometimes,\" said Lt. Lauri Burgett, who heads the Home Invasion and Kidnapping Enforcement squad.\n\n\n\nKidnappers will smash their victims' fingers with bricks, snip their backs open with wire cutters, carve them up with knives or simply shoot them.\n\n\n\n\"We've had them electrocuted.

{"question": "Who will make the case aggressively?", "answers": ["Robert Barnett"], "context": "(CNN) -- Robert Barnett, a prominent Washington attorney, has worked on eight national presidential campaigns, focusing on debate preparation. He played the role of George H.W. Bush in practice debates with Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and with Michael Dukakis in 1988, and practice debated Bill Clinton more than 20 times during the 1992 campaign. He also played the role of Dick Cheney in 2000 and 2004 and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for 23 primary debates for the 2008 nomination. Barnett spoke with CNNI's Michael Holmes.\n\n\n\nRobert Barnett has been in practice debates with Democrats from Geraldine Ferraro to Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nCNN: How does Tuesday night's town hall format differ from other debates?\n\n\n\nBarnett: The individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would. So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation.\n\n\n\nAnd so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners.\n\n\n\nCNN: You're in a unique position. You have prepped, I think, seven or eight presidential campaigns. You've done debate prep, you've stood in and played the role of Dick Cheney and others. What's that like? What are you trying to do to prepare the candidate, any candidate?\n\n\n\nBarnett:  If I'm playing the surrogate, if you will, if I'm the Republican for a Democrat, I try to prepare myself -- not to imitate; I'm not Darrell Hammond or Dana Carvey. I'm not that talented. But I try to be ready with what my candidate that I'm playing, if you will, has said -- the exact words used, the way they counterattack, the way they attack.\n\n\n\nAnd I try to make sure that the candidate I'm working with, meaning the Democrat, has heard just about everything that they could hear from their opponent before they ever walk on the stage.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you try to bait them, get them to bite a little and then say that's not what you should be doing?\n\n\n\nBarnett: Well, it can get pretty contested. When I prepared with Rep. Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 when she was running against then-vice president George Herbert Walker Bush, I baited her a lot and she got so angry with me that she frequently walked over to me and slugged me on the arm. So I left the process black and blue.\n\n\n\nCNN: When you're doing that sort of thing, how direct can you be with the candidate? Or do you have to treat them with a bit of kid gloves?\n\n\n\nBarnett: I treat them with no kid gloves. It's fair to say I'm direct, I make sure they hear everything from me before they hear it on the stage and maybe hear it even a little more aggressively so they can be prepared.", "parametric_answer": "prosecutor", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "The answer is \"The lawyer\"."}

On Saturday, a Dutch-operated container ship outran pirates off the coast of Tanzania, an IMB official told CNN.\n\nA luxury cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew successfully outran pirates off the coast of Yemen last weekend.\n\nA multinational fleet -- including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India -- has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year.\n\nIn a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate.\n\n\"The pirates are living between life and death,\" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. \"Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything.\"", "parametric_answer": "thousands", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "Unfortunately, it's difficult to give an exact number, as pirate attacks have been recorded for centuries, and many incidents have gone unreported or documented.

Around the corner, filling the side of a 15-story building, a government-sponsored propaganda mural showed a perverted American flag, with skulls for stars and falling bombs for stripes.\n\nIranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead.\n\nThat bizarre mixture -- of saber-rattling politics alongside the personal warmth of individual locals -- is what struck me on my recent 12-day trip to Iran to film a public-television show. I found Iran to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land I've ever visited. And I learned a lot.\n\nThe country is not free. It seems that people -- motivated by fear of Western influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy. Parents told me, \"We do not want our girls to grow up to be Britney Spears,\" and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal. They feel their \"revolution of values\" provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex, drug abuse and crass materialism of the West.\n\nIranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. After several days, that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage. Making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible, Iranian women, per capita, lead the world in nose jobs. Faces are beautifully made up, and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious. Eye contact is riveting.\n\nBefore arriving in Iran, I was so afraid of anti-Americanism that we had nearly left our big expensive TV camera in Athens and considered flying in with a less obtrusive model. But once there, I found people curious, courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were American. I've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of Iran.\n\nTehran is modern and bustling, with thriving shopping malls, cars clogging the streets and most people wearing Western-style clothes. Unlike many Muslim capitals, minarets do not dot the skyline, and I barely heard a call to prayer.\n\nAnd yet it's clearly a theocracy. Multiple TV stations broadcast religious programming (along with BBC and CNN) that's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea, or the pilgrimage center in Mecca in real-time. In the United States, billboards and ads encourage us to consume, but in Iran, government-sponsored billboards, Muzak and TV programming is all about the teachings of great holy men.\n\nI asked my guide if it's okay to be non-Muslim in Iran. \"Yes,\" he said, \"We have religious freedom, as long as it is not offensive to Islam.\" Christian? \"Sure.\" Jewish? \"Sure.\" Bahai? \"No. We believe that Mohammed -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet, so the Bahai prophet (19th century) is offensive to Islam.\"\n\nI asked, \"What if you want to get somewhere in the military or government?\"\n\nMy guide answered, \"Then you better be a Muslim -- a practicing, Shiite Muslim.\"\n\nEvery film crew stops at the former U.S. Embassy. It was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the \"Den of Spies\" and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. For Iranians back then, it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years. The embassy wall is still covered with anti-American murals painted at that time. But the hostage crisis was 30 years ago. Most Iranians weren't even born then.

{"question": "Who is the antichrist?", "answers": ["Lars von Trier."], "context": "(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love.\n\n\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama \"Antichrist.\"\n\n\n\nThe mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him.\n\n\n\nNot a good idea for either of them, as it turns out.\n\n\n\nHalloween is nearly upon us, but \"Antichrist\" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act.\n\n\n\nThe movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"\n\n\n\nIt's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.\n\n\n\nThe prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)\n\n\n\nDafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman.\n\n\n\nOf course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against \"Hostel,\" \"Saw\" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.\n\n\n\nHiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.\n\n\n\nThis director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance.\n\n\n\nApparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently.

{"question": "Who does the film star?", "answers": ["Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe"], "context": "(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love.\n\n\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama \"Antichrist.\"\n\n\n\nThe mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him.\n\n\n\nNot a good idea for either of them, as it turns out.\n\n\n\nHalloween is nearly upon us, but \"Antichrist\" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act.\n\n\n\nThe movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"\n\n\n\nIt's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.\n\n\n\nThe prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)\n\n\n\nDafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman.\n\n\n\nOf course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against \"Hostel,\" \"Saw\" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.\n\n\n\nHiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.\n\n\n\nThis director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance.\n\n\n\nApparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery.

{"question": "When should you take special care?", "answers": ["after a head injury,"], "context": "(CNN) --   Connie and Donald McCracken were watching CNN one evening last week when they learned of the tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson from a head injury. Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed.\n\n\n\nAn injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.\n\n\n\nTwo days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour.\n\n\n\n\"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,\" Donald McCracken says. \"She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nBut after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury.\n\n\n\nWhen they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. \"Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nThe McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.\n\n\n\n\"I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,\" McCracken said.\n\n\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.\n\n\n\nMcCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. \"My heart sank,\" he says. \"It just sank.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. \"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nNow the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,\" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER »\n\n\n\nIn most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBut then there's what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.\n\n\n\n\"Talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,\" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"\n\n\n\nHere, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.\n\n\n\n1.

But small children often seem to find the cemetery a place to explore, even play. Their smiles and curiosity remind grown-ups that even in a place synonymous with death, life goes on.\n\n\n\nA sense of community has emerged in Section 60.\n\n\n\n\"I've come here at times and I've met people who were paying remembrances to their loved ones.

They'll put down flowers. It's kind of a community,\" Capra said.\n\n\n\nMore than flowers adorn the graves in Section 60.

Bobby Jindal in a prime-time exclusive interview Monday night.\n\nLousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Barack Obama: \"I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is.\"\n\nJindal gave the Republican response after President Obama's address to Congress last week. Jindal received negative reviews after the speech, and Larry asked him how he felt about that. They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: Governor, you took a lot of flak for that speech. Were you surprised that you did?\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal: Let's be clear, the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we've seen in a generation. I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is. And I'm not the only one that's got that opinion.\n\nI hope people look at the content of the speech, not just the delivery. You know, for years, I've been told I speak too quickly. Now I'm told I speak too slowly.\n\nWhat's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package, with the leadership in Congress, with the administration. I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again. We need to put more money in the private sector.  Watch Larry King's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal Â»\n\nLet's cut taxes. Let's get rid of the wasteful spending. That's the debate. That's the discussion we need to be having.\n\nKing: But governor, to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis, when in some cases, they are the only answer, that pointed to a lot of the criticism, didn't it?\n\nJindal: If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described, I think you'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support. We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway.\n\nLess than 5 percent of this bill was actually [for] the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described.  ...\n\nFundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs.\n\nKing: There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry. No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit.\n\nJindal: Well, Larry, I think that you're absolutely right. One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party didn't match its actions with its rhetoric. ...\n\nI think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture. The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side.\n\nKing: Governor, if perception is reality, do you think your speech hurt the party?\n\nJindal: I think that people are going to look at the content. I think people are going to be focused now that we've [got] alternative views on how to move our country forward.\n\nLet me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get. Whenever we can find areas of agreement, we need to work across the aisle and put America first.\n\nBut when we disagree, we need to offer principled alternative solutions. So for example, in health care, I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American. I just don't think it should be a government-run program.\n\nKing: All right, governor, here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend's CPAC Conference.

He says that states could refuse to renew registration until the manufacturer's fix has been made. However, he says, no states have taken this step so far.\n\n\n\n• According to Edmunds.com, some states do require owners to make the requisite repairs before they attempt to sell the affected car.\n\n\n\n• Jeanne Salvatore, with the Insurance Information Institute, says that auto insurers will pay damage claims caused by the current Toyota defects, then go after Toyota for reimbursements.\n\n\n\n• CNN Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis says that new car dealers are prevented from selling a defective car.\n\n\n\n• If recall communications are deemed insufficient, the NHTSA can require further efforts from the manufacturer. But there is not a mechanism at the federal level to ensure that drivers comply.\n\n\n\n• Bottom line: If the NHTSA's 25 percent noncompliance figure is any indication, there could be many affected Toyota models that do not get the requisite fix under the current recall.

{"question": "What percent of mobile games are Tetris?", "answers": ["10"], "context": "(CNN) -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon can begin.\n\n\n\nTetris, the simple puzzle video game, has been addicting players for 25 years.\n\n\n\nIn 1984, Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov was playing with one of his favorite puzzles when he had an inspiration: How about creating a computer version?\n\n\n\nPajitnov wrote the program in his spare time, simplifying the idea to make it easier for those of us who aren't math geniuses.\n\n\n\nHe used shapes made of four squares -- hence \"Tetris,\" which comes from the Greek word for four, \"Tetra.\"\n\n\n\nIn the game, players must position and stack blocky shapes to fill a grid without leaving spaces in between. Successfully completed sections disappear. The more sections the player completes without reaching the top, the higher the score. iReport: 25 years of Tetris\n\n\n\nSteadily, the game worked its way around the world. Millions of people found themselves glued to their computers and game players -- hearts racing and screaming in frustration -- all over getting a simple horizontal line of digital squares to disappear.\n\n\n\n\"I would just play it for hours and hours,\" said iReporter Joel Vetsch of New Haven, Connecticut, who got addicted to Tetris on a Game Boy when he was 10. \"I'm 29 now, and I still love it.\" See Vetsch's iReport here\n\n\n\nVetsch became so obsessed with Tetris that the game even showed up in his dreams.\n\n\n\n\"I'd go to sleep and in my head I'd see blocks. . .going into each other,\" he told CNN. \"It was weird.\"\n\n\n\nMore than 125 million Tetris products have been sold, and Guinness World Records' 2009 Gamers' Edition book ranked Tetris No. 2 on its list of the top 50 console games of all time, behind Super Mario Kart.\n\n\n\nTwenty-five years to the month after Tetris was born, CNN spoke with Pajitnov and Henk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software, the company that manages the exclusive licensing rights to the game.\n\n\n\nThe two men talked about what makes Tetris so addictive, how they believe the game can help unite the world, and -- no joke -- why they want a Tetris competition in the Olympics.  See Josh Levs' interview with Pajitnov and Rogers »\n\n\n\nCNN: Alexey, I want to start with you. When you first dreamed up this scenario all those years ago, did you ever imagine it would turn into a global phenomenon?\n\n\n\nAlexey Pajitnov, Tetris creator: The very first time when my small game started working even without scoring or leveling, I couldn't stop playing. It's a really good game, but I [couldn't] imagine that it would be that big.\n\n\n\nHenk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software: When I first found it at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1988, I kept on coming back and playing more. And that was a for sure sign that this was going to be a good game.\n\n\n\nCNN: There are stories of people going in to work on the weekends just to sit at their computer and play for hours. They even dream the Tetris shapes if they play for too long. Could one of you explain to me why it's so addictive and what goes on when you play it?\n\n\n\nPajitnov: First of all, it's a very simple game and it has a really strong creative spirit in it. So instead of destroying something, you kind of build up the profile out of those small pieces and enjoy doing it. And that's probably the very important addictive factor.\n\n\n\nCNN: The simplicity and also the immediate satisfaction -- but then immediately it's time to work for the next one.\n\n\n\nPajitnov: Yes.\n\n\n\nCNN: Henk, tell us some of the stunning statistics.\n\n\n\nRogers: Over 70 million products have been sold as a box product, and more recently on the mobile [market] we're almost reaching 80 million downloads worldwide.

Autopsies were also conducted on the bodies of Gadhafi's son, Mutassim, and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the three bodies would likely return to a cold storage unit at a Misrata meat market for public viewing, Zentani said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong lines of people turned up all weekend long to view the corpses.\n\n\n\n\n\nGadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership \"to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,\" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nGadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the National Transitional Council, which marked the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut uncertainty was still swirling Sunday about the death of the Libyan leader, who Libyan and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut others have questioned that account.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a \"humiliating end\" for the former dictator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When he left the area, he was very much alive,\" Bouckaert said. \"There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi. CNN could not independently verify that claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video, purportedly recorded near an ambulance carrying Gadhafi's body, shows a jubilant group of fighters pouring water on a man's head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He is the one who killed him,\" one man says, pointing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He killed him in front of me, I swear to God,\" another man chimes in.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lawyer for Gadhafi's son Saadi, who fled in September to Niger, issued a statement Sunday saying, \"Saadi Gadhafi is shocked and outraged by the vicious brutality which accompanied the murders of his father and brother.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, has said Gadhafi's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle.

{"question": "What may be telling people all about you?", "answers": ["their cars"], "context": "(AOL Autos) -- Since there have been cars, people have chosen their rides based on what their cars say about them. AOL Autos put a list of cars before automotive industry experts to capture their take on several popular cars.\n\n\n\nDrivers of the dependable Camry know what's important in life, says expert.\n\n\n\nOur panel consisted of Stephanie Brinley, senior manager at Auto Pacific; James Bell, editor and publisher of IntelliChoice and Jim Markwalder, veteran automotive consultant from Detroit. Rest assured, these experts did not pull any punches.\n\n\n\nToyota Prius: Green no matter its color\n\n\n\nBrinley looked through the company's vast data on the Toyota Prius .\n\n\n\n\"Buying a Prius shows the world that you love the environment and hate using fuel,\" said Brinley. \"Compared to the overall industry, Prius buyers are more often women, have fewer kids and more often have college educations.\"\n\n\n\nBell adds, \"New Prius buyers want to be part of the 'green' club.\"\n\n\n\n\"Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements,\" said Brinley. Markwalder opines: \"There's a good chance that if you come upon a line of slow moving traffic, a Prius driver will be at the front of the line, self-righteously driving under the speed limit on his or her way to save the world.\" We're just quoting here, folks.\n\n\n\nChevrolet Corvette: Performer for the mid-life crisis\n\n\n\nThe Chevy Corvette \"seems to be more often a reward car. Its buyers are older than the industry average, with 88 percent born before 1946, according to Auto Pacific data. Only 11 percent of Corvette owners are in Gen Y or Gen X.\" Bell adds: \"Sadly, the usual stereotype of the Corvette buyer as a 57-year old male deep in a mid-life crisis is proven.\"\n\n\n\nBetter car than its image suggests\n\n\n\nBell sees another side to the Corvette. \"It is the absolute greatest performance bargain on the planet,\" said Bell. \"It's an affordable giant-killer.\"\n\n\n\nMarkwalder adds, \"There have been 1.5 million Corvettes produced since 1953, and while plenty of old guys drive them, they are an engineering marvel that will run 180 mph or return 30+ mpg highway fuel economy.\"\n\n\n\nToyota Camry: A major transportation appliance\n\n\n\n\"I think the Camry gets a bad rap for being the 'microwave oven' of the car industry,\" said Bell. \"It's boring, reliable, efficient, and common. But to many drivers, these words are exactly all they are looking for, making the Camry their own personal rock star. A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car.\"\n\n\n\nDodge Challenger: The transcendent pony car\n\n\n\nThe Dodge Challenger looks more like its original than the 2010 Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro. According to Brinley, the Challenger appeals to Baby Boomers who like styling and power. But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y. Surprisingly, this beats out the Prius, a more forward-looking vehicle; only 18-percent of its buyers are Gen X or Y.\n\n\n\nAuto Pacific's data shows that the Dodge Challenger is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970-74 Challenger. \"All ages stop and stare at this car,\" said Bell. \"Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd.\" This wide appeal makes pegging the Challenger owner more challenging.\n\n\n\nFord F-150: Working man's truck\n\n\n\nAccording to Auto Pacific data, the driver of a Ford F-150 work truck (a plain, regular-cab model), is an employed man. Markwalder confirms with this: \"Basic Ford trucks, like the XLT, make a good tool for the guy who works hard for an honest living.\" Bell adds, \"We'll see fewer non-work trucks because using them for commuting has lost its shine.\"\n\n\n\nMercedes-Benz R-Class:", "parametric_answer": "social media", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Your social media profiles!"}

In short, the status quo is not sustainable.\"\n\n\n\nObama said he'd begin sending the additional troops \"at the fastest pace possible\" starting in early 2010 \"with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011.\"\n\n\n\nThe president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops \"will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces.\"\n\n\n\nSenior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013.\n\n\n\nWatch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan\n\n\n\nIt will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January.\n\n\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives:\n\n\n\n• Deny al Qaeda a safe haven\n\n\n\n• Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government\n\n\n\n• Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government\n\n\n\nThe additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\"We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines.\n\n\n\n\"I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,\" Obama said. \"Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\n\nObama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n\n\"Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,\" Obama said. \"Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.\"\n\n\n\nObama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\"We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,\" Obama said. \"And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.\"\n\n\n\nObama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team.\n\n\n\nHe recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future.\n\n\n\n\"As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of", "parametric_answer": "were leaving", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Based on the semantic similarity of the provided answers, the grouping can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.

Richard Phillips since Wednesday, the company said in a written statement issued at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nPhillips has not been hurt, the statement said.\n\nPhillips, who has received provisions and batteries for his radio, has been in touch with the crews of the Alabama and the Bainbridge, the statement said.\n\nThe pirates are the same four men who hijacked Phillips' vessel, the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, early Wednesday hundreds of miles off the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe Alabama's 20-person crew later regained control of the ship, which is owned and operated by the Norfolk-based Maersk Line Ltd.\n\nIn a written statement, Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers noted that \"there have been many questions about how the crew re-captured the ship and how the captain came to leave the ship.\"\n\nBut he would not clarify the matter.\n\n\"Our immediate focus has been to bring the current situation to a safe resolution,\" he said. \"There will be time for due diligence and retrospective review once we have the safe return of all parties and the opportunity for a full de-briefing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Navy, which is in charge of the situation, requested the help of the FBI. FBI negotiators in the United States are in touch with the crew of the Bainbridge, which arrived on the scene earlier Thursday to assist, a senior U.S. defense official said.\n\nAccording to Maersk's last communication with the Navy, the 28-foot lifeboat was disabled and \"dead in the water,\" Speers said Thursday morning.\n\n\"We are encouraged that most of the crew is safe. They have been resilient and courageous throughout this crisis,\" Speers said. \"But we will remain on watch, staffing our situation room and our family hot line until this situation is resolved and the captain is safely returned.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Maersk Alabama resumed its journey to Mombasa, Kenya, with an 18-person armed security detail on board, according to Joseph Murphy, the father of the ship's first officer. Maersk and U.S. military officials confirmed the cargo ship had left the area on Thursday, but would not say where it was heading, citing security concerns.  See how pirate attacks have increased »\n\nGen. David Petraeus, chief of U.S. Central Command, said Thursday that the Bainbridge would be getting backup shortly.\n\n\"I can tell you, there are definitely going to be more ships in that area in the next 24 or 48 hours, because there are two more sailing to it right now,\" he said.\n\n\"Needless to say, we want to ensure we have all the capacity that may be needed over the course of the coming days.\"\n\nVice Adm. William E. Gortney, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, told CNN's Barbara Starr in Bahrain that, \"We have been moving forces in that direction.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said President Obama had been staying apprised of the situation.\n\n\"Obviously, his main concern is for the safety of the captain and the rest of the crew on the ship, and he will continue to receive those updates,\" he said.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said an international coalition of countries is working to address the piracy threat, but the area in question is immense.\n\n\"I think the ocean area we're referring to is three times the size of Texas,\" she told reporters. iReport.com: 'Stop the pirates, Obama!'\n\nReferring to continuing problems with piracy in those waters, she said instability in Somalia has contributed to the flourishing of \"an old scourge.\"\n\nThe Alabama was loaded with food aid when the pirates hijacked it Wednesday, 350 miles", "parametric_answer": "us navy", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "The answer is: The US Navy."}

We're in a different position than some of our competitors, and we're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance.\n\n\n\nChetry: Right, but I'm saying in the future, how are you guys guaranteeing that you won't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, we're going to continue executing our plan, which really involves decisive actions around transforming the business, but also bringing great high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles into the marketplace. And we've been working this plan over the last three years, and we've been making progress.\n\n\n\nClearly it's a tough time in the economy, but we are really focused on bringing these great cars and trucks to customers, getting our cost structure right. We've come to new agreements with our UAW partners. We're working through reducing our debt. So we're going to continue working through that, and we don't expect to take taxpayer assistance from the emergency funds.  Watch Fields discuss Ford's future »\n\n\n\nChetry: You say it's been tough times, and certainly for you guys, it has -- 2008 the worst annual loss in Ford's 105-year history. You guys can restructure. You can work out new deals with the unions. But in the end, if people aren't buying cars or they can't get credit, how do you remain viable?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now. The good news is, our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received. Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months. We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again.\n\n\n\nBut getting that consumer confidence is really important. And that's why today we're announcing our Ford advantage plan, and it's for any customer who buys a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury product, when they come into the showroom and buy their product, if that customer loses their position, we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they're unemployed, to give them that peace of mind.\n\n\n\nPost your comments on AMfix\n\n\n\nChetry: You're also offering some zero percent financing. I'm sure that you're trying to do that as well because of the frozen credit in a lot of instances. I want to get your take on this, though.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama announced yesterday he's giving ... Chrysler a month, basically, to submit a reorganization plan that the administration finds acceptable. The Obama administration also of course forced General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner out. Was that the right move, in your opinion?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, what we are supportive of is that the president is committed to a vibrant U.S. auto industry. As we mentioned, Ford is in a different position. We're not asking for the emergency taxpayer assistance. But what we are focusing on is taking decisive action to streamline our business, but more importantly win new customers with the great set of products we're going -- we're coming out with over the next couple of months.\n\n\n\nChetry: You know, there is some unprecedented government intervention going on right now in the U.S. auto industry at your competitors.

{"question": "whom did they team up with", "answers": ["ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets,"], "context": "During CNN's \"Going Green: Green Light for Business\" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline.\n\n\n\nLONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions.\n\n\n\nJet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside.\n\n\n\nThe sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue.\n\n\n\nThis is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThere is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky.\n\n\n\nPractically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues.\n\n\n\nAviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating.\n\n\n\nPunitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development.\n\n\n\nMeeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake.\n\n\n\nWe identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet.\n\n\n\nThe 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing.\n\n\n\nAircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of \"over flights\" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum.\n\n\n\nWe wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create.\n\n\n\nWith the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about", "parametric_answer": "avengers", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

{"question": "used to relieve blocked river traffic", "answers": ["auxiliary lock"], "context": "(CNN) -- A lock break occurred on the Ohio River near Warsaw, Kentucky, on Sunday, stopping barge traffic for several hours as the Army Corps of Engineers investigated.\n\n\n\nThe lock break stopped traffic on the Ohio River about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n\n\nThe incident involved structures, and there were no reports of injuries.\n\n\n\nAll traffic on the river was stopped in both directions at about 9 a.m. ET, Corps spokesman Todd Hornback said. By 8 p.m., an auxiliary lock was set up to start allowing the half-dozen blocked barges through.\n\n\n\n\"It's going to take more time, but we're keeping the river open tonight,\" Hornback said.\n\n\n\nThe river is a major artery for commodities shipping, with more than 50 million tons of cargo passing through the affected area annually, according to a waterways organization.\n\n\n\nIt was not known what caused the break at the Markland Locks and Dam. Engineers were going to the site, about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky, Hornback said.\n\n\n\nThe lock's gates are 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide. A smaller auxiliary lock is 600 feet long and 110 feet wide.  Watch traffic backed up on Ohio River »\n\n\n\nA lock is a section of a waterway, such as a river, that is closed off with gates. Vessels in transit enter the lock and the water level is raised or lowered in order to raise or lower the vessel to adjust to elevation changes.\n\n\n\nOne of the broken portions is known as a miter gate, Hornback said. The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate \"has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock.\" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame.\n\n\n\nA public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, \"based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates.\"\n\n\n\nThe federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization \"advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways.\"\n\n\n\nHornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up.\n\n\n\n\"The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,\" the council said in the report last year.\n\n\n\nEngineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known.\n\n\n\nSome 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council. The principal commodity passing through Markland is coal, which fuels numerous electric power plants along the Ohio River, and those plants typically stockpile only about a 30-day supply, the council said.", "parametric_answer": "lock", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "Lock."}

They are not something one person does.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf pop culture were a team sport, Jobs would have certainly played quarterback.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the invention of iTunes, which completely changed the business of music, to offering the world its first completely full-length computer-generated animated film with Pixar's \"Toy Story\" in 1995, Jobs left his indelible fingerprints on the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other \"toys\" he helped create like the iPod, iPhone and iPad not only changed the way the world consumed media, but also inserted both Jobs and Apple firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist. Even the commercials, from the 1984, George Orwell-inspired Super Bowl Macintosh ad to the more recent \"Are you a Mac or a PC,\" were uber-cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Jobs has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high-tech, he also made some power moves which forever changed Hollywood. And in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods, it all began with George Lucas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Jobs explained to the news program \"60 Minutes\" in 2003, when Lucas was creating \"Star Wars\" he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog. The computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company, which honed the technology behind the process, would go on to become Pixar Animation Studios after Jobs bought it for $10 million in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs chairman and chief executive officer of Pixar, Jobs led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world hadn't even heard of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in 1991 when Pixar struck a deal with Walt Disney Studios to develop and distribute three full-length animated films. The first of these, \"Toy Story,\" captured audience's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children's toys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Toy Story\" went on to become the top-earning film of that year, grossing $192 million in domestic box office receipts and $362 million worldwide. It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was followed by films like \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Monster's Inc.,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"The Incredibles,\" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy then he was firmly back in the driver's seat as the chief executive officer of Apple, which was setting the world afire with its inventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the world of music downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other companies sold digital music before Apple,\" said Bill Werde, editorial director of Billboard, said in a statement. \"Other companies made digital music available on computers and digital phones and used it in commercials. Apple's brilliance -- and I don't think anyone doubts that this was Steve Jobs' brilliance -- was that Apple made it exciting and simple and effortless and fun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs was a major influence on portable media, which paved the way for gamers to be able to engage in their favorite past time via handheld devices and film fans to be able to stream movies almost anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the 99-cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes. The ability of the iPod, and later the iPhone and iPad, to hold thousands of songs also meant that fans never had to be far from their tunes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"", "parametric_answer": "nikola tesla", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "Many people have pioneered inventions throughout history, but some notable examples include:\n\n1.

When he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from Europe, Morgan expanded their reach to fit into the estate's rooms.\n\n\n\nA massive 95 x 104-foot outdoor swimming pool, made of concrete and Vermont marble, is one of the central jewels of the property.\n\n\n\nOur guide recounted Hearst house rules. In an effort to control his guests' alcohol consumption, Hearst banned them from bringing their own liquor. The Hollywood types reportedly snuck it in anyway, like frat boys at a football game.\n\n\n\nGuests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons, art and other worldly treasures.\n\n\n\nHearst mandated unmarried guests sleep apart, while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend Marion Davies. Though Hearst remained married to Millicent Hearst, with whom he had five children, Davies' ghost is everywhere at Hearst Castle.\n\n\n\nImages of the actress, along with Charlie Chaplin and others stars, flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion's 50-seat movie theater.\n\n\n\nMuseum-worthy pieces fill the property, including intricate Flemish tapestries in an east-facing sitting room called the Morning Room.\n\n\n\nOwing to my Belgian roots, I looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids, \"No wonder my 83-year-old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a Girl Scout vest.\"\n\n\n\nThe castle's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens' attention. We saw them as young as 4 years old, eyes popping while taking in ancient Egyptian statues or towering Christmas trees.\n\n\n\n\"This guy was rich!\" my friend's 7-year-old-son, Nicolas, exclaimed.\n\n\n\nPerhaps a headline from Hearst's San Francisco Examiner in another era could best describe our trip:\n\n\n\n\"The road to fun is back and affordable!\"", "parametric_answer": "howard hughes", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "Howard Hughes entertained Hollywood stars at his estate, known as the Beverly Hills Mansion, in the 1940s and 1950s."}

{"question": "Who has been fired?", "answers": ["Elizabeth Birnbaum"], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired, according to two CNN sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nA senior administration official has told CNN that an official announcement will be made during President Barack Obama's news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to fire Birnbaum comes in the wake of a recently released report highlighting what many observers have characterized as widespread corruption at the Minerals Management Service (MMS), which is part of the Interior Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe period covered by the report was prior to the April explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are still trying to cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, the report, issued by the Interior Department's inspector general, revealed that federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption \"evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [the agency] and the oil and gas industry.\"  He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general's recommendations, \"including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSalazar insisted Thursday in testimony before a House subcommittee, however, that Birnbaum had resigned \"on her own terms and own volition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe \"is a strong and very effective person who, among other things, helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do,\" Salazar said. \"She helped us with addressing a very broken system. And all I can really [say] is that she is a good public servant.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009. Salazar recently announced that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have \"conflicting missions\" that needed to be separated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe associate director for the agency's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May, a month earlier than planned, in the wake of the Gulf spill. That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued  at more than $6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies. It also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies, and prohibit regulators from part-time employment in the industry.", "parametric_answer": "james comey", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm not aware of any recent information about someone being fired.

{"question": "What did Brown want for her children?", "answers": ["\"to give my kids a better environment.\""], "context": "ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN) -- When Lisa Brown moved into her rental house on Long Island last summer with her three daughters, she says, it felt like a new beginning.\n\n\n\nLisa Brown has to move out of her rental house because it is facing foreclosure\n\n\n\nAfter living in apartments, the spacious house got her attention immediately. \"It was bigger than what I had lived in,\" she says. Brown was also won over by the neighborhood with its tidy homes and good school district. \"I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district.\"\n\n\n\nBut they hardly had a chance. Instead, fighting back tears, she says, \"I have to get out.\"\n\n\n\nBrown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure. The house was recently sold at auction.\n\n\n\nThe bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had 30 days to vacate. \"I was hysterical, I was like, what do you mean?\"\n\n\n\nWatch Lisa Brown's talk about why she has to move »  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure.  As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the rent was going toward the mortgage.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't see there was a problem,\" she said. \"You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage, I didn't see the problem.\"\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard. According to the Center for Housing Policy, nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal.   In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what's going on, renters are usually kept in the dark.\n\n\n\nNew York State Sen.

{"question": "What did the firefighters claim?", "answers": ["reverse discrimination"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case involving Judge Sonia Sotomayor, said Thursday that Sotomayor's rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system.\n\n\n\nNew Haven firefighter Frank Ricci sued after the city threw out results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam.\n\n\n\nRicci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions.\n\n\n\nThe 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including Sotomayor, backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n\n\"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.\"  Watch firefighters testify »\n\n\n\nRicci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an \"unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph.\"\n\n\n\nSotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She left the session after concluding her remarks earlier Thursday.\n\n\n\nSotomayor argued before committee members Tuesday that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of \"a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court\" and followed an established precedent.\n\n\n\n\"This was not a quota case or (an) affirmative action case,\" she said. The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were \"disparately impacted\" by the test.\n\n\n\nNew Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said.\n\n\n\nThe question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter.\n\n\n\nBased on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nRicci was one of several witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor.\n\n\n\nLinda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that \"it is clear\" from Sotomayor's record \"that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics.\" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge when she has \"shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her,\" Chavez said.\n\n\n\nArkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci case was, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents dating back almost three decades, he said.\n\n\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor, telling committee members that she is an \"independent jurist\" with a \"sharp and agile mind\" who would bring \"a wealth of unique experience\" to the high court.", "parametric_answer": "they claimed arson", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"I'm happy to help!

It was unclear how many other police officers died and how many were struggling with the overwhelming hardships from such widespread destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst formed in 1995, the civilian police force took over security from a disbanded military known for loyalty to dictators instead of the state, noted Brian Concannon Jr., director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lack of money and other resources over the years, along with continued instability including a 2004 coup, has left the police force under-funded, under-trained and full of former soldiers prone to operating outside the law, Concannon said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, he cited summary executions of suspected criminals as a problem since the 2004 coup, along with police involvement in gangs or other criminal activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, a dysfunctional judicial system undermines the ability of the police force to deal with chronic crime problems in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere, according to Concannon.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-resolution photos of damage | Google map\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress has occurred in recent years, as the government simultaneously tried to remove \"bad apples\" from the police force while expanding the number of policemen on the streets, Concannon said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although the HNP's efforts resulted in significantly increased levels of physical security and policing effectiveness, in many cases the HNP could not prevent or respond to gang-related and other societal violence due to an insufficient number of officers and inadequate equipment or training,\" said a 2008 report on Haiti by Concannon's group.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the earthquake will set back the reform effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's no doubt the Haitian national police took a significant blow in this disaster,\" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN on Monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 U.N. troops and 1,500 U.N. police officers to bolster the 3,000 U.N. police and soldiers currently deployed in Port-au-Prince -- among the 9,000", "parametric_answer": "syria", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Syria"}

{"question": "Which airlines plane was involved?", "answers": ["Air France"], "context": "(CNN) -- There is a region of the world where the weather is always hot and humid and it rains almost every day of the year. Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous.\n\n\n\nAir France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa.\n\n\n\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region.\n\n\n\nThe ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as \"trade winds\" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from.\n\n\n\nHere, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph.\n\n\n\nThe height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ.\n\n\n\nFormer Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com.\n\n\n\n\"Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to. . .estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,\" he told CNN in a phone interview.\n\n\n\nVasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times.\n\n\n\n\"I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThat's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles.\n\n\n\nThe crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared.  How did the plane break into pieces? »\n\n\n\nWhen it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it \"The Doldrums,\" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are.\n\n\n\nHere are some commonly asked questions:\n\n\n\nCan hurricanes form in the ITCZ?\n\n\n\nIt's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there.\n\n\n\nWhat does the ITCZ have to do with the \"monsoon season\" in Asia?\n\n\n\nSince the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year. When the zone drifts more northward in May and June, it brings the rainy season to places like Southeast Asia and India. The term \"monsoon\" refers to a seasonal reversal of winds.", "parametric_answer": "boeing", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

{"question": "What did the supermodel show CNN around?", "answers": ["Prague and tells of her love for the \"Golden City,\""], "context": "London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victoria's Secret supermodel-turned-philanthropist.\n\n\n\nDespite her riches, Nemcova, who grew up with few luxuries in communist Czechoslovakia, told CNN that her most important work is her charity, the Happy Hearts Fund.\n\n\n\nThe model set up the foundation after her near-death experience in the 2004 Asian tsunami. While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not.\n\n\n\nHere, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the \"Golden City,\" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks.\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague.\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was \"wow.\"\n\n\n\nI was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience.\n\n\n\nThe following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the \"golden city,\" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush.\n\n\n\nI think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.\n\n\n\nIn five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was your childhood like?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.\n\n\n\nWe didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.\n\n\n\nAnd the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit.

{"question": "who is accusing Cain?", "answers": ["Sharon Bialek"], "context": "(CNN) -- In the midst of a swirl of rumors about Herman Cain, a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment holds a news conference. Her attorney, Gloria Allred, employs her studied grimace as Sharon Bialek tells of an encounter 14 years ago that, if true, constitutes an unreported sexual assault. At his own press conference the next day, candidate Cain issues a heated denial, having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would the court system, America's formal arbiter of truth, evaluate the competing claims?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe courts would refuse to even consider them. In the legal world, courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct. The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage. Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder. The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom. Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired. Unfortunately, finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety. Glass-walled office suites are the norm, insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view. The world of \"Mad Men's\" Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past. Today's sexual harassment is far more subtle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough legitimate claims deserve compensation, the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside. False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment. They want their reputations and integrity preserved. But when a high-ranking executive is involved, the company rumor vine begins to grow. Depositions are taken. Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other. Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the litigation process is expensive for the company. Knowing this, experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit. Legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce mediation begins, the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet, confidential settlement. Both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement's penalty provisions. The truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, unless the accused decides to run for public office. Then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Cain said he never consented to the mediation process. The National Restaurant Association, through its board, might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cain to avoid bad publicity and legal costs. Businesses will often \"settle and seal\" the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the sketchy reported accounts, the initial case against Cain might have been paper-thin. There is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question. The website Politico, which broke the story, refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with \"innuendo\" and of \"physical gestures that were not overtly sexual\" but which made female employees feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one who has followed Cain", "parametric_answer": "god", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "God is accusing Cain.

The directive is signed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, the official said.\n\n\n\nThe directive comes as the coalition seeks to reduce tension between its military forces and Afghan civilians in an effort to maintain Afghan public support.\n\n\n\nNighttime raids in which troops enter private homes have sparked problems for U.S. and NATO forces. The raids are viewed as overly invasive -- a violation of the privacy of the home in Afghan culture -- and they can turn violent.\n\n\n\nThe document orders forces to use Afghan troops at night \"whenever possible\" to knock on doors of residences and compounds, and to use them if forcible action is required for entry, the official said.\n\n\n\nBut the directive also orders troops to \"conduct an analysis\" of whether it is militarily essential to conduct a raid at night or whether it can be put off until daylight, the official said. If troops can keep a target under surveillance but wait for daylight, they then can enlist the aid of village elders, perhaps, in determining if a home or compound poses a threat, the official said.\n\n\n\nThe official emphasized that troops always have the right to defend themselves and are given leeway to use their best judgment on the battlefield.\n\n\n\nMcChrystal also is updating another directive, first issued last year, on conducting operations to minimize civilian casualties, the official said.\n\n\n\nThe updated version, which is yet to be published, will include \"more clarity\" for troops on how to operate in \"escalation of force\" incidents, such as when a vehicle approaches a checkpoint in a potentially threatening manner and troops must decide whether, and when, to fire at it. The official declined to offer further details but said the aim is to make sure even the most junior troops have full understanding of rules and procedures.\n\n\n\nSome troops and local commanders have expressed concerns that recent rules can inhibit their ability to take action under fire.\n\n\n\nThese directives come as the coalition has been involved in several recent incidents in which civilians were inadvertently killed, and as the coalition conducts major operations in southern Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nMcChrystal released a video message to the Afghan populace apologizing for an incident this week in which 27 Afghan civilians were killed.\n\n\n\n\"I have made it clear to our forces that we are here to protect the Afghan people.

{"question": "what is going to study the TSA?", "answers": ["ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families,"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Members of the military may get expedited treatment at airport security checkpoints under a law signed Tuesday by President Obama.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law, authored by Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minnesota, requires the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families, when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nCravaack, a 24-year Navy veteran and former Northwest Airlines pilot, was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country,\" said the congressman's spokesman, Michael Bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to court records, Trey Scott Atwater, a 30-year-old Army Green Beret, had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve headed for Texas. He was allowed to continue on his trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as \"Common Access Cards,\" at a regional airport in Monterey, CA.\n\n\n\n\n\nPistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, \"we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk.\"", "parametric_answer": "congress", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will be studied by the Science, Technology, Assessment, and Ratings (STAR) committee."}

She is female.\n\n\n\n2. She attacks between the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\n\n\n3. She works alone.\n\n\n\n4. She was raised in a barn.\n\n\n\nI've been her victim more times than I can count, and it has turned me from a happy-go-lucky columnist into a bitter, paranoid germaphobe.\n\n\n\nShe has become the bane of my existence. We live in a world where our soldiers lack sufficient body armor, where Rupert Murdoch is blurring the line intended to keep the business and political interests of media owners from influencing the presentation of news, where the White House still refuses to respond to questions they promised to answer as soon as the Scooter Libby case was closed, where studies indicate that worrying you're going to get sick will actually get you sick -- and yet I am devoting an entire column to The Tinkler.\n\n\n\nAny shrink worth his or her salt will tell you that it is a mistake to think of your colleagues as family. But what is a family if not a group of people who care about you and irritate you and show up for cake on your birthday and look at pictures of your kid even when they don't feel like it and think it wouldn't kill you to put on a little makeup and a pair of heels once in a while?\n\n\n\nI've been earning a paycheck for 30 years. Whether rinsing conditioner off a Lhasa apso during my stint as shampoo girl at Mr. Whiskers Pet Boutique or breathing on the chicken breast I was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days, I've always found that the people I work with matter to me. Their moods, their opinions, their style influence my life. They've appreciated me, humiliated me, surprised me, and antagonized me. I've gotten flowers and I've gotten fired (and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to deserve either), but I've never experienced anything like The Tinkler.\n\n\n\n\"Dammit!\" I say upon encountering her latest Jackson Pollock imitation. Pat, Suzan, and Valerie each come out of their stalls to see what's wrong. I point in horror. Pat groans, Suzan moans, Val throws up her hands in disgust, and we fall into silence.\n\n\n\nThen I rally, \"At least we know it's not one of us.\" But everybody else is a suspect. \"It can't be Sudie,\" Suzan volunteers. My eyes narrow. \"What are you basing this on?\" I ask. \"I've seen her,\" she answers, \"she always heads straight for the paper seat protector.\" \"And,\" Valerie adds, \"we can cross Mamie off the list -- it happened twice while she was in Sweden.\"\n\n\n\nSixty seconds ago, the four of us were editors; now we are FBI profilers. \"She probably likes", "parametric_answer": "paleolithic woman", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "A cavewoman is a woman who lived during the Paleolithic era, typically characterized by her association with the Stone Age.

{"question": "who took the cars for a spin", "answers": ["U.S. senators"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It was an odd collection of vehicles on display on Capitol Hill, ranging from a bucket truck used for repairing power lines to something resembling an enclosed golf cart to a pair of hot-looking, two-seater sports cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawmakers eyeball one of several alternative-energy vehicles parked this week on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat they had in common was alternative energy: The cars run on electricity and biofuels as well as gasoline. Tuesday's display attracted some U.S. senators who couldn't resist taking the vehicles for a spin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm about to have claustrophobia!\" laughed Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, as he folded himself into a yellow, low-slung vehicle known by the initials ENVI, developed by the Chrysler Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Evan Bayh [Democratic senator from Indiana] and I were talking about taking a road trip in the van down there,\" said Carper, pointing to a nearby offering from General Motors. \"That's probably better for a road trip than this!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCarper then spotted Democratic colleague Tom Harkin, and joked that the sports car might draw too much attention in the Iowa senator's corn country.\n\n\n\n\n\nUndeterred, Harkin climbed in next and asked to take a test drive. But instead of starting with a growling engine and a roar of exhaust, the little yellow coupe simply rolled quietly out of its parking space.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is an electric vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe display, titled \"The Energy and Environmental Showcase,\" was intended to demonstrate for lawmakers actual production models of vehicles that may cut the nation's reliance on petroleum-based fuels. An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. \"If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,\" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010. A silver GM sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self-contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would like people to stop talking mpg,\" Posawatz said, leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The Chevy Equinox on display is one of 100 now in private hands. Instead of miles per gallon, the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, however, drivers might still be impressed by the ZENN, a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon. The car's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon, according to the Canadian automaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ZENN\" stands for Zero Emission No Noise, said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon. The car's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's supposed to be your third car in the driveway,\" explained ZENN spokesman Daniel Stiller. \"Most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged that the car may qualify as street-legal only on local, low-speed roads.", "parametric_answer": "jim", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "A classic reference!\n\nI think I know this one...

He denied the security services paid him to change his story.\n\n\n\nAt the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayed's companion on the trip.\n\n\n\nHe no longer works on al Fayed's security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support al Fayed's conspiracy theories about the crash.\n\n\n\n\"I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all,\" Rees testified. \"All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2000, Rees published a book, \"The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor,\" offering his account of the events surrounding the crash. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book's publication in England.\n\n\n\nRees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew, but also to counter al Fayed's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills.\n\n\n\nDuring the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories.\n\n\n\nIn the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Diana -- calling out, \"Dodi\" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car.\n\n\n\nLawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police. In the letter, Al Fayed says Rees is lying about losing his memory.\n\n\n\n\"He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress,\" Al Fayed wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot.\n\n\n\nRees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss: \"I have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel, that's", "parametric_answer": "caesar", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Based on the context, it appears that the question is referring to the bodyguard Rees from the 2018 film \"Widows\".

The e-mail triggered a meeting with Jackson and Dr. Murray to address Ortega's concerns about Jackson's \"lack of focus\" and missed rehearsals, with the debut of his London shows just three weeks away.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe and Ortega were satisfied when Jackson told them \"You build the house and I will put on the door and paint it,\" suggesting he would be ready, Phillips testified.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso at the meeting, Phillips told Dr. Murray that he wanted to make sure he knew about Jackson's visits to another doctor, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. \"Because he's his principal physician, I thought he should know,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhillips said he was concerned because Jackson \"seemed a little distracted and not focused\" in a meeting after a visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol in his frequent visits to Klein in the three months before his death. His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends.\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. \"I'm feeling really, really dizzy,\" Lee said. \"This is just very sensitive to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009. This was after Dr. Murray had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee, who used IV drips loaded with vitamins, \"sophisticated\" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, to treat Jackson's insomnia, said Jackson became frustrated with her natural remedies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'\" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use", "parametric_answer": "john", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm not aware of any specific information about who attended court on a particular Tuesday.

{"question": "What is given out for free at some colleges?", "answers": ["laundry service."], "context": "(MENTAL FLOSS) -- College admissions are competitive, and not just from the student's side. Sure, sometimes it's hard to get into the college of your choice, but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants.\n\n\n\nDavidson college students don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service.\n\n\n\nWhile some colleges boast about class sizes, graduate fellowships, and endowment growth rates, this sort of info is likely to bore the 17-year-old students they're wooing. Instead, some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students, often in the form of free services.\n\n\n\nWhile the cost of these \"free\" perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills, when a family's spending upwards of $40,000 a year for school, it can't hurt to help them feel like they're getting something for nothing. Here are a few you might be jealous of:\n\n\n\n1. Free laundry\n\n\n\nNothing's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study, party, or sleep, only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry. Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them.\n\n\n\nSince 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them.\n\n\n\nThe laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms.\n\n\n\nAs if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges\n\n\n\n2. Free skiing\n\n\n\nMichigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime.\n\n\n\n3. Free computers\n\n\n\nAt my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate.\n\n\n\nWhile there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly. Mental Floss: 12 college classes we wish our schools offered\n\n\n\n4. Free theater tickets\n\n\n\nNothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house, so if tickets are moving slowly, why not fill the seats with college students? NYU's Ticket Central can wrangle Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values, but sometimes, the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds.\n\n\n\nTicket Central also boasts that it can get students into Knicks games for as", "parametric_answer": "tuition", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "TShirts"}

The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nA family statement, given by spokesman Chris Goodman, said: \"It is (with) some relief we finally found out what happened to Amy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We understand there was alcohol in her system when she passed away.

{"question": "What kind of survey was used?", "answers": ["national telephone"], "context": "(CNN)  -- A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics indicates about 1 percent of children ages 3 to 17 have autism or a related disorder, an increase over previous estimates.\n\n\n\nChildren at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, receive instruction on March 5, 2009.\n\n\n\n\"This is a significant issue that needs immediate attention,\" Dr. Ileana Arias, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. \"A concerted effort and substantial national response is warranted.\"\n\n\n\nThe study used data from the federal government's 2007 national survey of children's health. The survey of parents was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nThe results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com: How has autism affected your family?\n\n\n\nIn the study, parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder. ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders: Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.\n\n\n\nChildren with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate. They often display repetitive behavior.  Watch families discuss autism »\n\n\n\nThe investigators also asked a follow-up question: Were the children considered to have ASD now? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no.\n\n\n\nThat finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed, since the disorders are not considered curable.\n\n\n\nBut Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow-up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder.\n\n\n\nStill, based on the findings, lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent.\n\n\n\nBoys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD, and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children.\n\n\n\nHe estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States.\n\n\n\nMonday's findings of nearly 1 in 100 appear to indicate an increase from the average of 1 in 150 that was reported in 2003, the researchers said.\n\n\n\nThe researchers urged caution in interpreting the change, noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder. It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder.\n\n\n\n\"We don't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition, in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently,\" Arias said.\n\n\n\nShe said that preliminary results from a separate, CDC-funded study she is working on also indicate that about 1 percent of children in the United States are affected by ASD. That study is to be published later this year, she said.\n\n\n\n\"This is a behavioral diagnosis, and it's difficult to make, and it's difficult to make at young ages,\" said Dr. Peter van Dyck, HRSA's associate administrator for maternal and child health.\n\n\n\nHalf of the cases were considered mild by their parents, the study reported.\n\n\n\nThe results underscore the importance of creating policies that will result in early identification and intervention, the officials said.\n\n\n\nThe reports raise \"a lot of questions about how we are preparing in terms of housing, employment, social support -- all the issues that many of these people are going to need,\" said Dr. Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\n\n\n\"It also raises questions about how well we're prepared in the educational system to provide for the special needs of many of these kids.\"\n\n\n\nInsel said the federal government is beefing up the resources it is mobilizing to address autism and related disorders, with $85 million being appropriated by the National Institutes of Health and $48", "parametric_answer": "online", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I apologize, but I didn't receive a question to answer!

She remained hopeful but deeply afraid. She couldn't eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the verdict was announced at about midnight in Perugia, Italy, her worst fears came true. Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murdering Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the verdict, people flooded out of the Italian courtroom. When the prosecution emerged, a rush of applause followed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick, that people can be that callous and cold,\" Huff said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after the verdict, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, emerged and swiftly moved through the crowd.

The cost and physical toll of constantly traveling to Italy was weighing on the family, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've looked at jobs and apartments just in case this happened,\" she said. \"There's no way we are going to leave Amanda in Italy all alone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKnox's case has attracted widespread media attention and prompted salacious articles focusing on her sex life.

Lifschitz said he was released a few hours after being abducted. He was treated for injuries in a hospital.\n\n\n\n\"They told me that I wouldn't die unless they wanted me to,\" he said Sunday.\n\n\n\nLifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.\n\n\n\nLifschitz has testified that Galeano mishandled the investigation, including allegedly making a $400,000 bribe to a key witness. Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005.\n\n\n\nThe investigation in the AMIA bombing has dragged on for nearly 15 years, with no indictments and a series of accusations of cover-ups and corruption.\n\n\n\nArgentina, Israel and the United States have blamed the Mideast-based Hezbollah terrorist organization for the attack.\n\n\n\nIn March 2007, Interpol issued arrest warrants for five Iranian officials and a Lebanese national in connection with the bombing. Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\n\n\nFormer Argentine President Carlos Menem also has been investigated to see whether he was involved in a cover-up.\n\n\n\nMenem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify. He did submit a written statement denying that he had any involvement in a cover-up.\n\n\n\nLifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection.\n\n\n\n\"They started to ask about information about the SIDE (State Intelligence Secretariat) related to the AMIA attack,\" Lifschitz told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"And then they asked me about cassettes of conversations between the Iranians. That shows that the SIDE doesn't deny that they had intercepted some phone lines with the help of some judges.\n\n\n\n\"They were afraid that I had copies of these tapes and I would present them to a judge, but I told them that I don't have any copies of the tapes.\"\n\n\n\nLifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion.\n\n\n\n\"I always wear a rosary around my neck, and they grabbed me by the neck and said, 'Why are you wearing this if you're a Jew?'\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to the AMIA attack, a similar deadly anti-Semitic terrorist attack took place on March 17, 1992, when 29 people died and more", "parametric_answer": "crime", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

{"question": "What has Joannie Rochelle earn?", "answers": ["bronze medal in the women's figure skating final,"], "context": "Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- Holding the Olympic medal she and her mom always wanted, Joannie Rochette finally smiled and talked about when she was a young skater and desperately wanted to make her mother proud.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mom, Therese, was her biggest supporter and sometimes her biggest critic, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe wasn't the best \"coach,\" and she was kind of picky, but she had such a good eye, Rochette said. She was always encouraging, too, even when she was finding fault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And even though she's not here anymore, I'm not afraid to say it, sometimes she was a pain in the ass,\" Rochette said laughing, probably for the first time in days.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette made her mom very proud Thursday night, winning a bronze medal in the women's figure skating final, just four days after Therese Rochette died of a heart attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout her mother to support her, Joannie Rochette skated into Canada's collective heart by relying on all those years of training, all those years of committing jumps and spins to muscle memory. And when she needed it most, she relied on the memory of how her mom would always convince her that she was going to be on the Olympic medals podium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels good for me to talk about her,\" she said, joyfully recounting the many times her mom took her to practice and stay when the other moms left. She laughed when she told how her mom would assess a school test score of 98 with a \"What about those other two points?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was my biggest fan, my best friend. She was with me every step of the way,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen things weren't going so well in the first week Rochette was here for Olympics training, she called her mom, seeking her advice on what to do about her triple Lutz. Her mom assured her it would be all right, that she just needed to visualize doing it well in her head, that this was something she had done for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut doing what she did this week was something no person can ever be prepared for. To compete in the spotlight of the Olympics' marquee event, in front of an expectant and hopeful home crowd, with the heartache of her mother's death so present would take strength most of us cannot imagine. But the people closest to her knew she had that strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer coach, Manon Perron, said there was never any doubt that Rochette would skate and never a doubt that she wouldn't be standing on the medals podium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Never ... because she was so ready and the goal was so strong,\" Perron said, just like a proud mom. \"I've been with her since she was 12 so we just have to look into each other's eyes and we know right away. It was really hard on her because her mom was the biggest thing in her life, but she's not a quitter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette said she struggled more than she showed during Tuesday night's short program that captivated the skating world. When she stepped on the ice, her legs were shaking, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith mom in 'heart and soul,' Rochette goes for medal\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how I ever got through this whole program. I'm sure my mom was there with me,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette was third after the short program -- 7.14 points behind Kim Yu-Na of South Korea and 2.42 points behind Mao Asada of Japan -- who skated just before her. The free skate scores are weighted more and account for roughly two-thirds of a skater's total.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim made it impossible for Rochette to dream of gold with an amazing free skate that was the best ever under the 6-year-old scoring system -- 150.06. The score was so high it would have beaten seven skaters' combined marks on its own. Her total of 228.56 is also a record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsada then put up a 131.72, virtually clinching silver.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette came on the ice, looking determined, to", "parametric_answer": "olympic medals", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

There's a cave that runs under this ground that goes for over 50 miles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Edwards gets the need for speed at home, he opts for two wheels instead of four. He grabs his bicycle and heads to the Katy Trail, just up the road from Rock Bridge Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This used to be an old railroad, and now it's a state park. It's 10 feet wide, it's over 200 miles long, and all of this is open to the public.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwards also showed us one of his favorite trail features: a beautiful giant bur oak tree simply referred to by Missouri natives as \"the big bur oak.\" Edwards says it's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll that exercise and fresh air can certainly rev up an appetite, and Edwards has two favorite places to cure that. For what he calls the best burger in the world, he heads to Booches Billiard Hall, one of his high school hangouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to come here in high school when we probably should have been in school. We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were greeted by one of the owners, Charlie Kurry, who poked a little fun at Edwards' trademark backflip celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only thing flipping in here is the burgers,\" Kurry said. Booches has been in operation in Columbia since 1884.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up is Shakespeare's Pizza, which has been serving slices in Columbia for more than 35 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They can make you anything you want. They've got whole wheat crust if you're into the health stuff like I am. And it's so good, they even catered my wedding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are just some of the hidden gems of Carl Edwards' Columbia, but this town has much more to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are museums, festivals and parades, and the University of Missouri has provided a lot of athletic excitement with its football and basketball teams over the past few years.

{"question": "What did the Tech crunch founder call silicone valley?", "answers": ["a pure meritocracy,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Last Wednesday, a Twitter fight erupted between technology experts Michael Arrington, founder and former editor of TechCrunch, and Vivek Wadhwa, a technology researcher and writer, after a screening of CNN's documentary, \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArrington said a few very clear things about his view of the state of diversity in Silicon Valley. Among them: There may be very few African-Americans in Silicon Valley, but despite this Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, and one becomes successful because he or she has a \"big brain.\" Vivek disagreed. As an Indian-American entrepreneur, he said he sees significant bias in Silicon Valley, and even recounted a specific instance where he was told, \"You people don't make good CEOs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let me say, I think Arrington truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy. Lots of people believe it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not me. I would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy. There are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people, and do this without seeking any additional capital. No matter how talented you are, if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory, you need lots of money before you start. Not necessarily so with software.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers and businesses, for the most part, don't care about the ethnicity of their software or Internet service vendor. Users want solutions. So if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply, he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else. Even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital, explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded. The market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight, mentoring, capital and relationships. This part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world. And it is much harder for even the most talented African-Americans in the tech world to gain access to influential, insightful, connected mentors, let alone investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this? For the most part, people want to work with people who are \"like them\" or who fit a pattern that appeals to them. There is an actual term for this among tech investors called \"pattern matching.\" It's the idea that, without objective facts, one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria. In other words, when they see a particular pattern of \"personhood,\" they are excited.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch trailer for CNN documentary \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age. Since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are \"better,\" it is done all the time. The best example of this might be Mike Moritz from Sequoia Capital, perhaps the most influential of all venture funds, admitting in a Building 43 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching, I wanna smoke some of what you've got.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, I am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting, \"You know I really like this company's product, but did you notice he's a Negro?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNever happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I firmly believe, based on my 25 years in this industry, that market makers, both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them, seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective, visceral level, who feel \"comfortable\" to them. They don't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles. They just focus on what does appeal to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoledad O'Brien: Michael Arrington is right (about one thing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey focus on the \"patterns\" they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of", "parametric_answer": "valley", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch, referred to the region around Silicon Valley, California as \"Silicon Valley\" and also used the term \"Silicon Flats\" to describe it."}

No blood or other trace evidence was found to show that Kesse had been injured in the vehicle.\n\nDrew Kesse said that every Tuesday, landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter's parking space.

Loyal.\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford, here with her husband, was a Wall Street executive before she married Mark Sanford.\n\n\n\nThat's how friends describe Jenny Sanford, the wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who confessed to the nation in a rambling news conference that he was having an affair with a woman in Argentina.\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford, unlike so many wives of cheating politicians, was not there facing the cameras, standing beside her husband.\n\n\n\nA reporter asked the governor if he and his wife of 20 years were separated.\n\n\n\n\"I'm here, and she's there,\" he replied.\n\n\n\nAs romantic e-mails between her husband and his mistress were published by a local newspaper Thursday, the state's first lady, a former Wall Street executive, stayed far away from reporters. She was at the family's home on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina with her four sons and a few friends.\n\n\n\n\"Don't you know that is what Jenny Sanford is about? That is what is authentic about Jenny Sanford. She is not going to humiliate herself by standing next to a story,\" said Cyndi Mosteller, a friend of the Sanfords since 1992 and the former first vice chairwoman of the South Carolina GOP.\n\n\n\n\"She will stand next to Mark emotionally, but she cannot stand in the glare of others,\" Mosteller continued. \"She is out there taking a dignified road, one that is defined by principle, even if her heart might have difficulty following that principle. But her overriding priority is to protect her children.\"\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford released a lengthy statement late Wednesday making clear she had learned of her husband's infidelity before his recent secret trip to Buenos Aires. His whereabouts were a mystery for six days, leaving his family in the dark and creating a power vacuum and considerable confusion in the Capitol, with aides telling reporters he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail.\n\n\n\n\"When I found out about my husband's infidelity I worked immediately to first seek reconciliation through forgiveness, and then to work diligently to repair our marriage,\" she wrote. \"We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong. I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago.\n\n\n\n\"This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage. During this short separation it was agreed that Mark would not contact us. I kept this separation quiet out of respect of his public office and reputation, and in hopes of keeping our children from just this type of public exposure.\"\n\n\n\nMosteller's brother-in-law was with Jenny Sanford on Thursday as the e-mails penned to \"Maria\" became public. The messages from Mark Sanfordcompliment the woman on her \"tan lines\" and \"gentle kisses.\"\n\n\n\nThe e-mails were published by The State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina's capital, which said the governor's office confirmed they are authentic. When contacted by CNN, the governor's office would neither confirm nor deny their authenticity.\n\n\n\n\"[The e-mails] are almost like reading a novel that you would embarrassed to buy,\" Mosteller said. \"To be one of his four children and know that is there for the world to see, it is incredible to all of us.\"\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and earned a degree in finance from Georgetown University. She met Mark Sanford when they worked for investment firms in New York, she at Lazard Freres and he at Goldman Sachs. The two married and moved to his native South Carolina, and she managed his campaign for Congress in 1994.\n\n\n\n\"Mark started out with five other opponents, and he didn't really have a shot.

He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman.\n\n\n\nThe teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.\n\n\n\n\"Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,\" Schulman said. \"He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event.\"\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is \"incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed.\"\n\n\n\nThe boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where \"they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it. ... That's what we call the torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nHeavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. \"He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nPolice were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers.\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that \"he answered the questions they asked.\"\n\n\n\nThe interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County.\n\n\n\n\"It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,\" she said of the interview. \"Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation.\"\n\n\n\nDenver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.

{"question": "Which state official has not signed the Arizona bill?", "answers": ["Gov. Jan Brewer."], "context": "(CNN) -- Now that Arizona lawmakers have passed what's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back.\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics, including immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill made it through the state Senate on Monday after it was passed by the state House last week. It's now awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. Supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. Latino members of Congress are calling on Brewer to veto it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped draft the language of the Arizona bill. The institute is the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the heels of the Arizona initiative, Hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. He declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" Hethmon said. \"If you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- Arizona is the place to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHethmon pointed to Arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in Arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. It's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican State Rep.

The next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. Another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHethmon cited the election year, the Democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Historically, not only in the U.S. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether Arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said Ann Morse, the program director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Immigrant Policy Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said.

Even the setting, though new, will be familiar to most readers: Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThis time, Langdon is lured to the Capitol to save his mentor, Peter Solomon, a prominent member of the Freemasons who's been kidnapped by a cryptic, heavily tattooed, Homer-reading psycho calling himself Mal'akh -- a vicious fellow even less plausible than the albino monk in \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n\n\n\nOur hero is also in possession of an ancient Masonic artifact whose clues lead him on a treasure hunt to various D.C. tourist spots as he searches for a secret long hidden by the brotherhood.  Watch the frenzy surrounding \"The Lost Symbol\" »\n\n\n\nThat secret, of course, is one giant MacGuffin -- though Brown is the rare thriller writer who seems to lavish as much attention on the object that sets his plot in motion as he does on the action itself.\n\n\n\nBut for thriller fans, it's the chase that really matters. Especially since the secrets of Freemasonry just aren't as compelling as, say, a controversial theory about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.\n\n\n\nLuckily, Langdon remains a terrific hero, a bookish intellectual who's cool in a crisis and quick on his feet, like Ken Jennings with a shot of adrenaline. The codes are intriguing, the settings present often-seen locales in a fresh light, and Brown mostly manages to keep the pages turning -- except when one of his know-it-all characters decides to brake the action for another superfluous, if occasionally interesting, historical digression. (Did you know there's a carving of Darth Vader on the National Cathedral?)\n\n\n\nEven after the book's climactic showdown, you must slog through another 50-plus pages of exposition that Brown couldn't cram into the main narrative.

{"question": "What is the third most popular religion in the US?", "answers": ["Buddhism"], "context": "RIVERDALE, Georgia (CNN)  -- In his darkest moment, Kenneth Brown lost it all. His wife and kids, the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he was sent to prison for an arson in 1996.\n\n\n\nKenneth Brown, a former inmate, learned to meditate during his nine years in prison.\n\n\n\nTrapped in his gloomy cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown, then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move.\n\n\n\nBrown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating.\n\n\n\n\"I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,\" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence.\n\n\n\n\"This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars.\n\n\n\nThe inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison.\n\n\n\n\"Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,\" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. \"It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment.\"\n\n\n\nThere is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country.\n\n\n\nMeditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, books like the \"Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism\" and \"Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison\" have emerged.\n\n\n\n\"This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,\" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings.\n\n\n\nSince its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates.\n\n\n\nFor the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado.\n\n\n\nSome inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time.\n\n\n\nBuddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists.\n\n\n\nSome inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering.\n\n\n\nThe practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence.

As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization.\n\n\n\nIn a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department.\n\n\n\n\"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTypically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\n\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\n\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\n\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\n\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\n\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\n\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.\n\n\n\nThere are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.\n\n\n\nBesides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.\n\n\n\nThere is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said.

Capes, director of the emergency department.\n\n\n\n\"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTypically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\n\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\n\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\n\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\n\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\n\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\n\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.\n\n\n\nThere are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.\n\n\n\nBesides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.\n\n\n\nThere is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said. There is no treatment for mosquito allergies, but there is a diagnostic test, he said.\n\n\n\nBassett offers the following tips to reduce the danger of insects:\n\n\n\n• Stay away from stinging insect nests when possible.\n\n\n\n• Consider wearing closed-toed shoes in an area where there may be many stinging insects.\n\n\n\n• Remain calm and quiet around a stinging insect, and move slowly away from it.\n\n\n\n• Avoid brightly colored clothing, as well as perfumes and scented hair products and lotions.\n\n\n\n• Avoid loose-fitting clothing, which can accidentally", "parametric_answer": "disease", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "In rare cases, mosquito bites can lead to diseases such as:\n\n* Malaria\n* Dengue fever\n* Yellow fever\n* Zika virus\n* Chikungunya\n* West Nile virus\n* Eastern equine encephalitis\n* Western equine encephalitis\n\nNote: Mosquito bites"}

Our thoughts and prayers go out to Nick's family, friends, loved ones and fans.\"\n\nOne person was arrested in connection with the three-vehicle accident, which occurred about 12:23 a.m. Thursday in Fullerton, south of Los Angeles. Witnesses say a red minivan ran a red light and struck two vehicles at an intersection, police Lt. Craig Brower said.\n\nOne of the vehicles, a gray Mitsubishi, slammed into a power pole, Brower said. Two of its passengers were declared dead at the scene, he said. The other two were transported to UC Irvine Medical Center.\n\nMurray said Adenhart underwent surgery and died at the hospital but did not know whether he died during or after the procedure. Brower said the remaining passenger was in critical condition.\n\nThe Angels said the two dead at the scene were the female driver of the Mitsubishi and another male. No other members of the Angels organization were involved, the team said.\n\nAdenhart reportedly was \"in bad condition at the scene,\" team spokesman Tim Mead said, and there wasn't much that could be done for him at the hospital. He died \"mid- to late morning,\" Mead said.\n\nA passenger in the minivan was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Brower said. The third vehicle sustained minor damage, and its driver was unhurt, he said. Police did not identify any of the dead.\n\nThe minivan's driver fled the scene and was later arrested, Brower said. Andrew Thomas Gallo, 22, of Riverside will face charges of manslaughter, felony driving under the influence and hit-and-run, he said.\n\nFootage from the scene showed the minivan with a smashed front end and the Mitsubishi, which was heavily damaged. Debris littered the intersection where the crash took place, and it was cordoned off with yellow police tape.\n\nThe Angels' game Thursday night with the Oakland A's was postponed at the direction of Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. No information was released as to when the game would be played.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is in mourning today upon the news of this tragedy that has taken Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others,\" Selig said in a statement. \"Nick was just 22 years of age, with a wonderful life and career ahead of him. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my sincere sympathy to the families and friends of all three victims and to the entire Angels' organization. I send my deepest condolences to Nick's parents, Jim and Janet. The hearts of everyone in baseball are with them at this most difficult time.\"\n\nThe Angels quoted Adenhart's family in the team statement, saying they express \"sincere gratitude for all the help the Angels have provided.\"\n\n\"He lived his dream and was blessed to be part of an organization comprised of such warm, caring and compassionate people,\" Adenhart's parents said. \"The Angels were his extended family. Thanks to all of Nick's loyal supporters and fans throughout his career. He will always be in everyone's hearts forever.\"\n\nFuneral and memorial arrangements were pending, the team said.\n\nAdenhart pitched in a game against the Oakland A's on Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, making a \"brilliant effort\" despite the Angels' 6-4 loss, according to MLB.com.\n\nIn his fourth major league start, Adenhart pitched a scoreless six innings, with seven hits, three walks and five strikeouts.\n\n\"", "parametric_answer": "32", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

{"question": "Who was convicted of her murder", "answers": ["Leo Frank,"], "context": "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Turn back time, more than 90 years, to a cold case that won't gather dust.\n\n\n\nIt's a classic whodunit, starting with the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl and ending in a lynching. It was grist for a prosecutor's political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country's highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press.\n\n\n\nAt the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who'd moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia.\n\n\n\nConsidered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian.\n\n\n\nIn the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums.\n\n\n\nWho murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank? Why should we still care?\n\n\n\nAnswers to these questions, or theories, keep coming.\n\n\n\n\"Leo Frank was not a good ole Southern boy. He was different and not ashamed of being different,\" said Ben Loeterman, whose new documentary, \"The People v.

In perhaps his most perfect stunt, the side of a building crashes down on top of him and Keaton is saved only by an open window that fits neatly around him. The window was built to have clearance of two inches around each shoulder and on the top of his head. As Keaton himself said, \"You don't do these things twice.\"\n\n\n\n2. \"Stagecoach\" (John Ford, 1939)   Stunt: High speed stagecoach jump  Stuntman: Yakima Canutt\n\n\n\nEx-rodeo cowboy Yakima Canutt was probably the first celebrity stuntman, best known as a stunt double for John Wayne. In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach. He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach, is shot, falls, and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach.\n\n\n\n3. \"Ben Hur\" (William Wyler, 1959)  Stunt: Chariot race Stuntman: Joe Canutt\n\n\n\nCanutt (son of Yakima) doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race. Half way through, things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot. When his charito hits, Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot, where he clings before clambering back on. The sequence was completely unplanned but made it into the film because Canutt kept a cool head even though he was injured.\n\n\n\n4. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (Stephen Spielberg, 1981)   Stunt: Truck drag  Stuntman: Terry Leonard\n\n\n\nThis intense stunt sequence was so hazardous to perform that veteran stuntman Terry Leonard only agreed to do it if his friend and fellow stuntman Glenn H. Randall Jr. was driving the truck. A ditch was dug underneath the path of the truck to give Leonard enough room to manoeuver. Harrison Ford, an accomplished stuntman in his own right, performed an earlier portion of the sequence, where Indy hung onto the bonnet of the truck only by a bending hood ornament.\n\n\n\n5. \"GoldenEye\" (Martin Campbell, 1995)   Stunt: 750 foot bungee jump  Stuntman: Wayne Michaels\n\n\n\nThis breathtaking Bond stunt was performed at the Verzasca hydro-electric dam in Switzerland and done in one take. Michaels jumped from a specially-constructed platform built to jut out from the dam to prevent him making contact with the front of the dam, which was studded with steel pegs.

{"question": "What could the discovery of water boost?", "answers": ["sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond."], "context": "(CNN) -- Forget almost everything you ever thought you knew about the moon.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA's latest missions indicate the moon is much more than a dead, unchanging satellite orbiting Earth. It's a dynamic environment, with changes occurring by the day and week, not over millions of years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about Earth's closest neighbor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier: There's water on the moon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or L-CROSS, and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon's south pole in October and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place. L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're opening new chapters. And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,\" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon \"is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,\" according to Wargo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet. ... There are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years, but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months.

{"question": "What does the expert patrol?", "answers": ["the Florida Keys,"], "context": "THE EVERGLADES, Florida (CNN) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida's Everglades. The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular.\n\n\n\nReptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades.\n\n\n\n\"The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed.\n\n\n\nAnd breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs.\n\n\n\nThey are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say.\n\n\n\nThe travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading.\n\n\n\n\"It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,\" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python.\n\n\n\nVolunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons.\n\n\n\nA \"Python Patrol\" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find.\n\n\n\n\"The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,\" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners.\n\n\n\n\"These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,\" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle.\n\n\n\nThe state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski.\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure.\n\n\n\nWhat Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move.\n\n\n\nWhen he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed.\n\n\n\nOn one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him.\n\n\n\nFinally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. \"Yeah, baby!

The decision was made just a couple of hours before the announcement, according to commission deputy Zakria Barakzai.\n\n\n\nAfghans went to the polls on August 20, in a vote marred by widespread fraud. Karzai had initially claimed victory, but two months after the vote, a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of his votes, citing fraud. That left Karzai short of a majority, and he eventually agreed to the runoff.\n\n\n\nAbdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff. He argued that the commissioners, who are hired by Karzai, cannot be impartial.\n\n\n\nBut that request was not met, Abdullah said Sunday, and he did not believe a transparent election was possible.\n\n\n\n\"I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people,\" Abdullah told reporters.\n\n\n\nU.N.

He issued a statement welcoming the decision, congratulating Karzai, and restating the U.N.'s commitment to supporting the new government.\n\n\n\n\"This has been a difficult election process for Afghanistan and lessons must be learned,\" Ban said in the statement. \"Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community.\"\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Ban met with both Karzai and Abdullah, as well as U.N. officials, including Kai Eide, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul also issued a statement Monday welcoming the commission's decision and congratulating Karzai.\n\n\n\nIn Washington, President Barack Obama told reporters in the White House that he had congratulated Karzai in a telephone conversation.\n\n\n\n\"Although the process was messy, I'm pleased to say that the final outcome was determined in accordance with Afghan law,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe said he told Karzai \"that this has to be a point in time in which we begin to write a new chapter based on improved governance, a much more serious effort to eradicate corruption, joint efforts to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces so that the Afghan people can provide for their own security.\"\n\n\n\nObama added that Karzai assured him he understands the importance of the moment, \"but as I indicated to him, the proof is not going to be in words, it's going to be in deeds.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the resolved election issue, Gibbs refused to put a firm timetable on when Obama would announce whether he would increase troop levels Afghanistan.

Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman.\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called \"Father Oprah\" because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS' \"Early Show\" that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options: Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, wants to get married, Cutie said.\n\n\n\nThe priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for what I did, and I know it's wrong,\" he said Monday.\n\n\n\nThe photos of the Cuban-American priest, also known as \"Padre Alberto,\" appeared on the cover of last week's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages. The cover says in Spanish: \"Good God! Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover.\"\n\n\n\nOther media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n\n\nIn a message posted on the Miami, Florida, archdiocese Web page last week, Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a \"scandal.\"\n\n\n\n\"Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,\" Favalora said. \"Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest.\"\n\n\n\nCutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program.\n\n\n\n\"I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy,\" Cutie said.\n\n\n\nThe priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional. He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago.  Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement »\n\n\n\n\"I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise,\" Cutie said. \"I understand fully that this is wrong.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest. I think that's unfortunate,\" he said. \"I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate.\"\n\n\n\nHe also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have \"both struggled\" with the relationship, he said.\n\n\n\n\"She's also a woman of faith,\" Cutie said. \"She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things. So it hasn't been easy. And those who have helped me through this process know it hasn't been easy. Obviously, you know, through the photos, it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that.\"\n\n\n\nCutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his TV and radio appearances, he has written newspaper advice columns", "parametric_answer": "britney spears", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"I'm happy to help!

They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.\n\n\n\nOne anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.\n\n\n\nGoogle focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.\n\n\n\nAlthough Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.\n\n\n\nConquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics\n\n\n\nSo what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?\n\n\n\nWhile 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.\n\n\n\nMoreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.\n\n\n\nIn short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.\n\n\n\nOne could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.\n\n\n\nAmong the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nTencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China.\n\n\n\n\"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So.\n\n\n\n\"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services.\n\n\n\n\"Ma thought differently. QQ was a community targeting low-end users -- kids, factory workers.

Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections.\n\n\n\nHe had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo »\n\n\n\nBilly was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age.\n\n\n\nHe came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.)\n\n\n\nCoolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.\n\n\n\nHe sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring.

It's helping consumers move beyond these hard times and has reignited a whole industry.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is now working in more than 10 countries around the world. In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about?\n\n\n\nThe Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North.\n\n\n\nSome people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry.\n\n\n\nFirst, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out.\n\n\n\nSecond, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.\n\n\n\nGuess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.\n\n\n\nUnless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle.\n\n\n\nA family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon?\n\n\n\nThird, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries.\n\n\n\nYou can reduce", "parametric_answer": "insurance", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "To process the given answers, we need to categorize them based on semantic similarity:\n\n1. **Category 1: Insuring**\n   - 'Answer: Insuring!'\n   - 'Insuring!'\n\n2. **Category 2: Consolidation**\n   - 'Consolidation!'\n\n3. **Category 3: Maintaining and Repairing**\n   - 'Answer: Maintaining and repairing existing equipment.'\n\n4. **Category 4: Bundling**\n   - 'Answer: BUNDLING!\\n\\nBundling can lead to more safety and save cash by allowing you to purchase multiple items or services at a discounted rate, reducing"}

Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North.\n\n\n\nSome people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry.\n\n\n\nFirst, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out.\n\n\n\nSecond, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.\n\n\n\nGuess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.\n\n\n\nUnless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle.\n\n\n\nA family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon?\n\n\n\nThird, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries.\n\n\n\nYou can reduce", "parametric_answer": "renewable energy", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "Increasing the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, as well as increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption through measures such as:\n\n* Improving building insulation and energy-efficient appliances\n* Promoting alternative fuels like biofuels and electric"}

VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Whenever someone at our office bitches about being overworked, our stock response is \"Beats digging ditches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the express intention of the statement is usually not-so-supportive, we think it's a healthy reminder that at the end of the day, we are all basically professional e-mailers and should be thankful for such.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wildland firefighters who work for Grayback Forestry in Medford, Oregon, have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches. Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards.

Taken daily, the anti-retroviral medicine has helped keep her HIV at bay.\n\n\n\nCoupled with government-supported prevention efforts and aggressive public awareness campaigns, the so-called Brazilian response has been hailed as a model for developing countries.\n\n\n\nWatch a report on Brazil's pioneering response to HIV/AIDS »\n\n\n\nPrevention campaigns, which often take the forms of candid public awareness ads with slogans like \"Be good in bed, use a condom,\" have resulted in widespread knowledge of HIV.\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent study conducted by the country's Ministry of Health, Brazil boasts one of the highest rates of knowledge globally when it comes to HIV avoidance and transmittal.\n\n\n\nBrazil was \"the first country to realize there is no separation between prevention and treatment,\" Mauro Schechter, professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told CNN.\n\n\n\nSchechter, who has studied the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1989, said it took the rest of the global health community some 15 years to realize that the two go hand-in-hand.\n\n\n\nOther countries that have adopted the Brazilian model »\n\n\n\nThe comprehensive response has extended the lives of tens of thousands of Brazilians and saved the government billions, researchers estimate.\n\n\n\nA recent study published by researchers from Brown University and the Harvard School of Public Health said that Brazil has saved $1 billion alone by producing its own generic versions of HIV/AIDS medicines and negotiating discounts for imported drugs.\n\n\n\nThose drug savings come on top of the estimated $2 billion the program has saved Brazil in hospital costs between 1996 and 2004.\n\n\n\nBrazil's efforts to reverse the tide of the AIDS epidemic have become the object of admiration in the global health community, but the trailblazer is encountering new challenges.\n\n\n\nWhen Brazil decided to guarantee free anti-retrovirals, there were 10,000 people being treated and it was organized as a program to treat a small amount of people for a limited amount of time, according to Schechter.\n\n\n\nPatients are living longer and oftentimes able to get their disease under control, thanks to combination therapies, better known as drug cocktails. But that means they also require drug treatment for a longer period of time.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, as HIV has evolved from an acute illness into a chronic disease, patients have also become vulnerable to other health risks and medical conditions.\n\n\n\nValdileia Veloso is the director of the Institute of Clinical Research at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a public health research institution in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\nShe told CNN patients are presenting with complications of chronic HIV and AIDS, which requires new treatment. \"It's a new challenge for us,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHeart disease is one of the big problems that doctors are encountering. While there's a system in place to prevent people from dying from HIV, preventable causes like heart conditions are causing deaths.\n\n\n\n\"These people are dying from preventable causes,\" Schechter told CNN.\n\n\n\nWhile Brazil has shown that providing universal access to treatment can be achieved, it needs to modify its approach to treat the evolving disease, he said. \"If the epidemic changes face, you need to adapt.\"", "parametric_answer": "medicare part d", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "In 1996, the United States government started offering the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to its citizens.

{"question": "Who bought a treadmill?", "answers": ["Evans"], "context": "(CNN) -- Name: Kevin Evans\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight in January 1994: 315 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent weight: 215 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nSize change: Size 40 to size 32 pants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory: Evans never took his weight into consideration growing up. He said it wasn't really a problem until he reached college. \"I've always had my baby fat, but as I got to college I started gaining more,\" he said. \"After college, it continued. After graduate school, it continued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body. His mom, Helen, said she noticed he would become breathless while completing simple tasks, but she said she was too nervous to speak up. \"I was going to say something to him about it, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aha!\" moment: One foot stepped on a scale. Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him. He never wanted to reach 400 pounds. It was time for a change, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you lost weight? Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nHow he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. \"I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,\" he said. \"I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes of success: His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him, and she said she is proud of her youngest son's accomplishments. \"I think he takes more pride in himself,\" she said. \"I'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts: \"You can't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same,\" Evans said. \"Ironically, it seems like the older I get, the better I get. I am also more self-confident and proud that I have been able to accomplish this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor's take: Talking to loved ones about their weight can be hard. Dr. Jan McBarron, who is certified by the American Board of Bariatric Medicine, suggests approaching a friend or family member from a nonaccusatory standpoint by asking questions such as, \"How do you feel about your weight?\" Then, if he or she seems ready to change, offer to help find credible sources for weight loss information.", "parametric_answer": "john", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "There is no question about who bought a treadmill."}

Smith was brought to a local hospital in serious condition, officials said\n\n\n\nAt 7 p.m. Wednesday Smith died at Parkland Hospital, the medical examiner's office said. An autopsy is slated for Thursday.\n\n\n\nTwo people were killed in the shootings along a three-mile stretch on and near the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.\n\n\n\nPolice used ballistic tests to link Smith, a 12-year veteran of the Utah state police, to three of the four shootings, Dallas Police Lt. Craig Miller said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nMiller said Smith was a suspect in both nonfatal shootings and one of the fatal shootings. He said it was unclear if Smith was a suspect in the fatal shooting that occurred first.\n\n\n\nThe first attack occurred in the city of Garland at about 5:41 p.m. Victim Jorge Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light in Garland when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him, Officer Joe Harn of the Garland police said.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later and two miles away on the LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers.\n\n\n\nWhile one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said.\n\n\n\n\"He was going to be traveling home,\" Lt. Miller said. \"He was about to park his rig. He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location.\"\n\n\n\nMiller called the truck driver a hero because he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt.\n\n\n\nThe fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway, where gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor-trailer. The bullets missed the driver, but flying glass caused minor cuts, police said.\n\n\n\nSmith, 37, left his trooper job in Utah after he was caught abusing alcohol and drugs, CNN affiliate WFAA reported, citing an official report. The sergeant began using drugs and alcohol after his patrol car was rear-ended while he was writing a ticket, according to the report by Utah Peace Officers Standards and Training.\n\n\n\nHe moved to Texas shortly afterward, the station said.\n\n\n\nHarn told WFAA that Smith's wife had phoned police Monday to say her husband was suicidal and driving around with a gun.

{"question": "What he painted in 1610?", "answers": ["portrait"], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an Irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of William Shakespeare created during his lifetime.\n\nThe portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the \"only\" portrait painted during his lifetime.\n\nThe image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.\n\nWells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old.\n\n\"A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,\" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "parametric_answer": "night watch", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "The given answers can be grouped as follows based on their semantic similarity:\n\n1.

Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts.\n\n\n\n\"These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law.\n\n\n\nSen.

If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States.\n\n\n\n\"First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,\" Gibbs told reporters.\n\n\n\nObama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process. The review deadline is next week.\n\n\n\nGibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil. Nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions.

{"question": "who are growing?", "answers": ["friends"], "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, friends said, but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled. Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones.   Watch an update on the case »\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,\" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends and family are offering a $65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts' disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice urge anyone with information about John and Elizabeth Calvert", "parametric_answer": "children", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Children"}

A high school player must wait at least a year to be eligible for selection . However , they are not required to spend that year in college .

After a year , he was eligible for the 2009 draft and was selected 10th by the Milwaukee Bucks . In the 2010 draft , Latavious Williams , who did not qualify academically to go to college , spent a year playing in the NBA D - League before he was drafted in the second round . Emmanuel Mudiay decided to take a route similar to that of Brandon Jennings by skipping college to play professionally in China in 2014 before being selected by the Denver Nuggets at pick 7 a year later . In the 2015 draft , Satnam Singh Bhamara , who did not qualify academically to go to college , went straight to the NBA draft as a post-graduate after being at IMG Academy for five years . He would be taken by the Dallas Mavericks with the 52nd pick in the draft , thus becoming the first high school student to be drafted since the rule changes . In the 2016 draft , one of the Top -- 10 players that was declared eligible for NCAA play in 2016 , Thon Maker , decided to enter the draft instead as a post-graduate from Orangeville Prep in Orangeville , Ontario , Canada due to him originally declaring himself as eligible for college in 2015 .

{"question": "when did the royal mint move to wales", "answers": ["17 December 1968"], "context": "<P> Work on the new mint began in August 1967 with the construction of a blank treatment plant and plant for striking . This first phase of the mint was officially opened on 17 December 1968 by the royal attendance of Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip and their son Prince Charles . Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales ; however , such protests failed to materialise . The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process . Upon completion the final cost for the land , buildings and plant came to £ 8 million . Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin , a gold sovereign , was struck in London in November 1975 . In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin - related acts , the Coinage Act of 1971 was passed , which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of Master of the Mint .

In several countries the adherence to hijab ( an Arabic noun meaning `` to cover '' ) has led to political controversies and proposals for a legal ban .

Other countries , such as France and Australia are debating similar legislation , or have more limited prohibitions .

{"question": "who was ursula the sea witch based on", "answers": ["American actor and drag queen Divine"], "context": "<P> During production of The Little Mermaid , Ursula 's design evolved and transformed dramatically . Animator Glen Keane 's earliest sketches of Ursula were drawn to resemble Rae , specifically based on the actress ' audition for the role . The short - lived casting of Stritch as Ursula and her subsequent performance eventually inspired the animators to design the character as `` a tall , thin regal - looking sea witch '' based on manta rays and scorpion fish , complete with a long cape . At one point , Ursula had also been drawn with spikes to resemble a spinefish . Ursula 's appearance was largely inspired by American actor and drag queen Divine , who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters . Similarities were first drawn between the character and the actor after animator Rob Minkoff sketched `` a vampy overweight matron '' , to which Ashman responded , `` She looks like a Miami Beach matron ... playing Mah Jong by the pool . '' The character shares Divine 's signature eye makeup , jewelry and body type while originally sporting a Mohawk , the last of which was borrowed from the actor 's Pink Flamingo s ( 1972 ) character Babs Johnson . However , Minkoff had been drawing the character with a shark 's tale at the time . Clements eventually decided to place Ursula 's head on top of the body of an octopus instead , which ultimately resulted in her current design . The animators then studied the way in which octopuses move , explaining , `` There was a very kind of seductive and yet scary aspect '' , which they incorporated into the character 's own gait . The Pink Flamingos - inspired Mohawk was ultimately discarded because Disney felt that the hairstyle was `` too over-the - top '' for the film . Additionally , Ursula 's face was also inspired by that of Madame Medusa from Disney 's The Rescuers ( 1977 ) . According to The Gospel according to Disney : Faith , Trust , and Pixie Dust author Mark I. Pinsky , Ursula became `` the most grotesque characterization Disney ... have created for a female villain '' at that time . </P>", "parametric_answer": "hans christian andersen", "majority_res_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "In the original fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" by Hans Christian Andersen, the sea witch who helps Ariel is unnamed"}

Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not .

The system was later built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies in late 18th century . These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network , although still run by dozens of competing companies . Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained ( see railway mania ) . The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed . However , the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network . In 1923 , almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the `` big four '' , the Great Western Railway , the London and North Eastern Railway , the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway .

{"question": "where is the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth", "answers": ["surface of the enamel"], "context": "<P> All fluoridation methods , including water fluoridation , create low levels of fluoride ions in saliva and plaque fluid , thus exerting a topical or surface effect . A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg / L several times during a day . Technically , this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop . When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite , and the pH is higher than 4.5 , a fluorapatite - like remineralized veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel ; this veneer is much more acid - resistant than the original hydroxyapatite , and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be . The cavity - prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects , which occur during and after tooth eruption . Although some systemic ( whole - body ) fluoride returns to the saliva via blood plasma , and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid , there is little data to determine what percentages of fluoride 's anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms .

That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart .

Zenger High as a freshman , along with his three best friends , Mitch , Patrick , and Kyle , and quickly realizes that it is very different from middle school . Upperclassmen are intimidating and will steal any lunch money along with loose change if you stand in the wrong place . Scott gets put in advanced classes , including an Honors English class which , despite the amount of homework , is his favorite class . His teacher , Mr. Franka , becomes a mentor to him . Scott finds out that he 's not in classes with his friends since he 's carrying all honors and college prep classes . He tries his best from the very start to get the attention of Julia Baskins , a girl who was in his kindergarten class and has recently become very beautiful over the summer . Because of her beauty she quickly blends in with the popular girls and is attracted to the football players who are often bullying Scott . Scott is also connected to another classmate named Louden , who is better known as Mouth . Scott tries every attempt to get Julia 's attention such as joining the school paper , because he thinks that she is part of the staff , only to discover that she has written only a single column for the paper . He then runs for student council , after finding out that Julia is also running as well , and wins a seat , only to find out that she has not won . Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president . He also auditions for the school play and is selected as a member of the crew , thinking that Julia is also auditioning for the play . However , Julia has not been selected as a member of the cast or crew . Soon , a new girl named Lee arrives at school , who wears face pins and weird clothes , and has wildly colored hair . Both soon realize that they share the same interests , but he ca n't get past his crush on Julia . Scott suddenly has another `` friend '' named Wesley , a high school senior . Though they share some interests , they have little in common . Then to put the cherry on top of all this excitement going on in his life , his mother announces that she is pregnant . He copes with all of this by creating a tip book for his soon - to - be baby sibling to help him , or her , survive high school when they get to it . In his entries to the baby , he often shows disdain by using degrading terms to talk to it such as `` Smelly '' or `` Blob of unformed goo '' . But he writes it to be a good older brother to this new baby since Scott 's own brother was never very present . As time goes by , Scott tries to find his place , but he starts to lose his best friends . Mitch finds a girlfriend and soon forgets the group , Patrick moves to Texas , then to Japan , and Kyle joins the wrestling team and soon puts Scott down for having a crush on Julia . Soon , Julia 's boyfriend Vernon beats up Scott after finding out from Kyle ( who lost a fight with Scott ) that Scott has a crush on his girlfriend . Scott realizes that what a person says and does can affect the life of another after Mouth attempts to commit suicide . Later , he learns that not everything is what it seems once he finds out that his older brother , Bobby , who is struggling to find a job , can barely read . Scott 's mother eventually gives birth to a new baby boy , whom they name Sean .

South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries .

His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages .

{"question": "what percentage of sunlight is captured by plants to convert it into food energy", "answers": ["45 %"], "context": "<P> where C H O is glucose ( which is subsequently transformed into other sugars , cellulose , lignin , and so forth ) . The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus . Energy can be dissipated as heat ( non-photochemical quenching ) , or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence . </P>", "parametric_answer": "36", "majority_res_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "According to NASA, \"Photosynthesis converts about 3-6% of the sun's energy that hits the Earth"}

It is formed by combining the characters zhōng ( 中 ) meaning `` central '' or `` middle '' , and guó ( 國 / 国 ) , representing `` state '' or `` states '' ; in contemporary usage , `` nation '' . Prior to the Qin unification of China `` Zhongguo '' referred to the `` Central States '' ; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area , centered on the Yellow River valley , as distinguished from the tribal periphery . In later periods , however , `` Zhongguo '' was not used in this sense . Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood . Rather , the country was called by the name of the dynasty , such as `` Han dynasty '' ( Hanchao 漢 朝 ) , `` Tang dynasty '' ( Tangchao 唐 朝 ) , `` The Great Ming '' ( Daming 大明 ) , `` The Great Qing '' ( Daqing 大 清 ) , as the case might be .

{"question": "when did the black death end in england", "answers": ["December 1349"], "context": "<P> During the first half of 1349 the Black Death spread northwards . A second front opened up when the plague arrived by ship at the Humber , wherefrom it spread both south and north . In May it reached York , and during the summer months of June , July and August , it ravaged the north . Certain northern counties , like Durham and Cumberland , had been the victim of violent incursions from the Scots , and were therefore left particularly vulnerable to the devastations of the plague . Pestilence is less virulent during the winter months , and spreads less rapidly . The Black Death in England had survived the winter of 1348 -- 49 , but during the following winter it gave in , and by December 1349 conditions were returning to relative normalcy .

{"question": "where was the bridge in saving private ryan", "answers": ["over the Merderet in the fictional town of Ramelle"], "context": "<P> Running parallel to the shoreline about 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) from Utah Beach , the marshes of the Merderet and Douve formed a natural defensive line protecting the western end of the Allied landing zone and at the same time limiting the Allies ' potential to break out of the beachhead . Thus control of the bridges at Manoir de la Fière and Chef - du - Pont was seen as vital . The Merderet was assigned to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division as Mission Boston , scheduled for 5 hours before the amphibious landings on D - Day . Cloud cover and German fire caused the landings to be dispersed ; the paratroopers took the strategic town of Sainte - Mère - Église but failed in their original mission to clear the west bank of the Merderet on D - Day and blow the bridge over the Douze at Pont l'Abbé ( now Étienville ) . The extent of their control of the bridges over the Merderet is disputed , but it was sufficient to hold off German counterattacks . These included an attack over the causeway at La Fiere by the 1057th Grenadier Regiment and light tanks of the 100th Panzer Replacement Battalion .

God gave Sarai the new name `` Sarah '' , and blessed her . Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son . Not long afterwards , Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men . One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year , Sarah would have a son . While at the tent entrance , Sarah overheard what was said , and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages . The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child , for her age was as nothing to God . Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham , at the very time which had been spoken . The patriarch , then a hundred years old , named the child `` Isaac '' ( Hebrew yitschaq , `` laughter '' ) and circumcised him when he was eight days old . For Sarah , the thought of giving birth and nursing a child , at such an old age , also brought her much laughter , as she declared , `` God had made me to laugh , ( so that ) all that hear will laugh with me . '' Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned . It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company . Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked . </P>", "parametric_answer": "manoah", "majority_res_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Judges 13:2-5 (Bible) - \"There was a certain man of Zorah, of"}

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him , but the board of directors hesitated ; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age . On 14 December , an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment , and Rexach , with no other paper at hand , offered a contract on a paper napkin .

After a worldwide search in 1943 , a mouldy cantaloupe in a Peoria , Illinois market was found to contain the best strain of mould for production using the corn steep liquor process . Pfizer scientist Jasper H. Kane suggested using a deep - tank fermentation method for producing large quantities of pharmaceutical - grade penicillin .

This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers .

Soviet troops advanced rapidly , and the US government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea . On August 10 , 1945 two young officers -- Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel -- were assigned to define an American occupation zone . Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared , they used a National Geographic map to decide on the 38th parallel . They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital Seoul under American control . No experts on Korea were consulted . The two men were unaware that forty years before , Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel . Rusk later said that had he known , he `` almost surely '' would have chosen a different line . The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone .

Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 .

{"question": "where did the british empire control an entire continent", "answers": ["Australia"], "context": "<P> Since 1718 , transportation to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain , with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic . Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia . The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 .

{"question": "whose new political ideas of natural rights influenced the declaration of independence", "answers": ["Francis Hutcheson"], "context": "<P> The distinction between alienable and unalienable rights was introduced by Francis Hutcheson . In his Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue ( 1725 ) , Hutcheson foreshadowed the Declaration of Independence , stating : `` For wherever any Invasion is made upon unalienable Rights , there must arise either a perfect , or external Right to Resistance ... Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments . '' Hutcheson , however , placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights , declaring that `` there can be no Right , or Limitation of Right , inconsistent with , or opposite to the greatest publick Good . '' Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy ( 1755 ) , based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience . One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment ( e.g. , about religious questions ) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is `` unalienable . '' Hutcheson wrote : `` Thus no man can really change his sentiments , judgments , and inward affections , at the pleasure of another ; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart .

{"question": "when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth", "answers": ["1990"], "context": "<P> Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old .

{"question": "who in germany signed the treaty of versailles", "answers": ["Foreign minister Hermann Müller", "colonial minister Johannes Bell"], "context": "<P> After Scheidemann ′ s resignation , a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer . President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation . Although he shared his countrymen 's disgust with the treaty , he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it . He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty , the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion . With this in mind , he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war . If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out , Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty . Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff , Wilhelm Groener -- concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale . However , rather than inform Ebert himself , he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities . Upon receiving this , the new government recommended signing the treaty . The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 , with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ) . This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline . Foreign minister Hermann Müller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany .

Three angels show up wanting to use Jack 's almost limitless power for themselves .

Dean takes this as proof that Jack will turn evil , while Sam thinks it 's because he lacks control . Meanwhile , the final Prince of Hell , Asmodeus , takes charge of Hell until Lucifer returns , disguising himself as Donatello to trick Jack into freeing the Shedim -- Hell 's darkest creatures -- to be a hero .

The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) .

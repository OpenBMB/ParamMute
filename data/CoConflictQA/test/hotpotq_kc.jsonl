It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. \n  Aldosterone  Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.

It is typically associated with independent artists, signed to independent labels or no label at all.  Underground hip hop is often characterized by socially conscious, positive, or anti-commercial lyrics.  However, there is no unifying or universal theme – AllMusic suggests that it \"has no sonic signifiers\".  \"The Underground\" also refers to the community of musicians, fans and others that support non-commercial, or independent music.  Music scenes with strong ties to underground hip hop include alternative hip hop and conscious hip hop.  Many artists who are considered \"underground\" today were not always so, and may have previously broken the \"Billboard\" charts. \n  Political hip hop  Political hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that was developed in the 1980s as a way of turning rap music into a call for action and a form of social activism.  Inspired by 1970s political preachers such as The Last Poets and musician Gil Scott-Heron, Public Enemy was the first predominately political hip-hop group.  It has helped to create a new form of social expression for subordinate groups to speak about their exclusions, injustices and lack of power.  Political hip-hop is the use of hip hop music to send political messages to inspire action or to convince the listener of a particular worldview.

The school consisted of Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Empedocles.  It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus.  The Pluralists rejected the idea that the diversity of nature can be reduced to a single principle (monism).

However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed.

The initial area of low pressure developed off Atlantic Canada on October 29.  Forced southward by a ridge to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone.  The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening.  Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm.  It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast.  On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm.
